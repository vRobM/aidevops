# AI DevOps Framework

**[aidevops.sh](https://aidevops.sh)** — An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) plugin and AI operations platform for launching and managing development, business, marketing, and creative projects. 13 specialist AI agents handle the automatable work across every domain so your time is preserved for real-world discovery and decisions that AI cannot yet reach.

> **Recommended setup:** [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) + [Claude](https://claude.ai/) models (Anthropic). All features, agents, and workflows are designed and tested for OpenCode first. Claude models (haiku, sonnet, opus) deliver the best results across all agent tiers.

*"Scope a mission to redesign the landing pages — break it into milestones, dispatch workers in parallel, validate each milestone, and track budget across the whole project"*

**One conversation, autonomous project delivery — with enterprise-level security & quality-control.**

Founded by [Marcus Quinn](https://github.com/marcusquinn) on 9th November 2025 to help anyone level-up their AI & Open-Source game.

## **The Philosophy**

**Maximum value for your time and money.** **[aidevops](https://aidevops.sh)** is built on these principles:

- **Autonomous orchestration** - An AI supervisor runs every 2 minutes, dispatching parallel workers, merging PRs, detecting stuck processes, and advancing multi-day missions — no human babysitting required
- **Multi-domain agents** - 13 specialist agents (code, automation, SEO, marketing, content, legal, sales, research, video, business, accounts, social media, health) with 900+ subagents loaded on demand
- **Multi-model safety** - High-stakes operations (force push, production deploy, data migration) are verified by a second cross-provider model before execution — different providers have different failure modes, so correlated hallucinations are rare
- **Resource efficiency** - Cost-aware model routing (local → haiku → flash → sonnet → pro → opus), project-type bundles that auto-configure quality gates and model tiers, budget tracking with burn-rate analysis
- **Self-healing** - When something breaks, diagnose the root cause, create tasks, and fix it. Every error is a live test case for a permanent solution
- **Self-improving** - When patterns of failure or inefficiency emerge, improve the framework itself. Session mining extracts learnings from past sessions automatically
- **Gap awareness** - Every session is an opportunity to identify what's missing — gaps in automation, documentation, coverage, or processes — and create tasks to fill them
- **Git-first workflow** - Protected branches, PR reviews, quality gates before merge. Sane vibe-coding through structure
- **Parallel agents** - Multiple AI sessions running full [Ralph loops](#ralph-loop---iterative-ai-development) on separate branches via [git worktrees](#git-worktrees---parallel-branch-development)
- **Progressive discovery** - `/slash` commands and `@subagent` mentions load knowledge into context only when needed
- **Open-source ready** - Contribute to any project the same way you work on your own. Clone a repo, develop solutions to issues locally, and submit pull requests — the same full-loop workflow works everywhere

The result: an AI operations platform that manages projects across every business domain — absorbing everything automatable so you can focus on what matters.

**Built on proven patterns**: aidevops implements [industry-standard agent design patterns](#agent-design-patterns) - including multi-layer action spaces, context isolation, and iterative execution loops.

## **Why This Framework?**

**Beyond single-task AI.** Most AI coding tools handle one conversation, one repo, one task at a time. aidevops manages your entire operation — dispatching parallel AI agents across multiple repos, routing tasks to domain-specialist agents, and running autonomously for days on multi-milestone projects.

**What makes it different:**

- **Autonomous supervisor** - AI pulse runs every 2 minutes: merges ready PRs, dispatches workers, kills stuck processes, advances missions, triages quality findings — no human in the loop
- **Cross-domain intelligence** - 13 agents spanning code, automation, business, marketing, legal, sales, content, video, research, SEO, social media, health, and accounts — each with domain expertise and specialist subagents
- **Multi-model safety** - Destructive operations verified by a second AI model from a different provider before execution
- **30+ service integrations** - Hosting, Git platforms, DNS, security, monitoring, deployment, payments, communications
- **Mission orchestration** - Multi-day autonomous projects broken into milestones with validation, budget tracking, and automatic advancement

## **Enterprise-Grade Quality & Security**

**Comprehensive DevOps framework with tried & tested services integrations, popular and trusted MCP servers, and enterprise-grade infrastructure quality assurance code monitoring and recommendations.**

## **Security Notice**

**This framework provides agentic AI assistants with powerful infrastructure access. Use responsibly.**

**Capabilities:** Execute commands, access credentials, modify infrastructure, interact with APIs
**Your responsibility:** Use trusted AI providers, rotate credentials regularly, monitor activity

### Security Commands

```bash
aidevops security              # Run ALL checks (posture + hygiene + supply chain)
aidevops security posture      # Interactive security posture setup (gopass, gh auth, SSH)
aidevops security status       # Combined posture + hygiene summary
aidevops security scan         # Secret hygiene & supply chain scan only
aidevops security scan-pth     # Python .pth file audit (supply chain attack vector)
aidevops security scan-secrets # Plaintext credential locations only
aidevops security scan-deps    # Unpinned dependency check
aidevops security check        # Per-repo security posture assessment
aidevops security dismiss <id> # Dismiss a security advisory after taking action
```

Running `aidevops security` with no arguments is the single command that covers everything — user security posture, plaintext secret detection, supply chain IoC scanning, and active advisories.

**Security advisories** are delivered via `aidevops update` and shown in the session greeting until dismissed. The scanner never exposes secret values — only file locations and key names. All remediation commands should be run in a separate terminal, not inside AI chat sessions.

**Supply chain hardening:** All Python dependencies are pinned to exact versions (`==`) to prevent malicious package upgrades. The `.pth` file auditor detects known supply chain attack indicators (e.g., the LiteLLM March 2026 PyPI compromise).

## **Quick Start**

### Installation Options

**npm** (recommended - [verified provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements)):

```bash
npm install -g aidevops && aidevops update
```

> **Note**: npm suppresses postinstall output. The `&& aidevops update` deploys agents to `~/.aidevops/agents/`. The CLI will remind you if agents need updating.

**Bun** (fast alternative):

```bash
bun install -g aidevops && aidevops update
```

**Homebrew** (macOS/Linux):

```bash
brew install marcusquinn/tap/aidevops && aidevops update
```

**Direct from source** (aidevops.sh):

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://aidevops.sh/install)
```

**Manual** (git clone):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcusquinn/aidevops.git ~/Git/aidevops
~/Git/aidevops/setup.sh
```

**That's it!** The setup script will:
- Clone/update the repo to `~/Git/aidevops`
- Deploy agents to `~/.aidevops/agents/`
- Install the `aidevops` CLI command
- Configure your AI assistants automatically
- Offer to install Oh My Zsh (optional, opt-in) for enhanced shell experience
- Guide you through recommended tools (Tabby, Zed, Git CLIs)
- Ensure all PATH and alias changes work in both bash and zsh

**New users: Start [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) and type `/onboarding`** to configure your services interactively. OpenCode is the recommended tool for aidevops - all features, agents, and workflows are designed and tested for it first. The onboarding wizard will:
- Explain what **[aidevops](https://aidevops.sh)** can do
- Ask about your work to give personalized recommendations
- Show which services are configured vs need setup
- Guide you through setting up each service with links and commands

**After installation, use the CLI:**

```bash
aidevops status           # Check what's installed
aidevops doctor           # Detect duplicate installs and PATH conflicts
aidevops update           # Update framework + check registered projects
aidevops auto-update      # Manage automatic update polling (every 10 min)
aidevops init             # Initialize aidevops in any project
aidevops features         # List available features
aidevops repos            # List/add/remove registered projects
aidevops detect           # Scan for unregistered aidevops projects
aidevops upgrade-planning # Upgrade TODO.md/PLANS.md to latest templates
aidevops update-tools     # Check and update installed tools
aidevops uninstall        # Remove aidevops
```

**Project tracking:** When you run `aidevops init`, the project is automatically registered in `~/.config/aidevops/repos.json`. Running `aidevops update` checks all registered projects for version updates.

### **Use aidevops in Any Project**

Initialize **[aidevops](https://aidevops.sh)** features in any git repository:

```bash
cd ~/your-project
aidevops init                         # Enable all features
aidevops init planning                # Enable only planning
aidevops init planning,time-tracking  # Enable specific features
```

This creates:
- `.aidevops.json` - Configuration with enabled features
- `.agents` symlink → `~/.aidevops/agents/`
- `TODO.md` - Quick task tracking with time estimates
- `todo/PLANS.md` - Complex execution plans
- `.beads/` - Task graph database (if beads enabled)

**Available features:** `planning`, `git-workflow`, `code-quality`, `time-tracking`, `beads`

### Upgrade Planning Files

When aidevops templates evolve, upgrade existing projects to the latest format:

```bash
aidevops upgrade-planning           # Interactive upgrade with backup
aidevops upgrade-planning --dry-run # Preview changes without modifying
aidevops upgrade-planning --force   # Skip confirmation prompt
```

This preserves your existing tasks while adding TOON-enhanced parsing, dependency tracking, and better structure.

**Automatic detection:** `aidevops update` now scans all registered projects for outdated planning templates (comparing TOON meta version numbers) and offers to upgrade them in-place with backups.

### Task Graph Visualization with Beads

[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) provides task dependency tracking and graph visualization:

```bash
aidevops init beads              # Enable beads (includes planning)
```

**Task Dependencies:**

```markdown
- [ ] t001 First task
- [ ] t002 Second task blocked-by:t001
- [ ] t001.1 Subtask of t001
```

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `blocked-by:t001` | Task waits for t001 to complete |
| `blocks:t002` | This task blocks t002 |
| `t001.1` | Subtask of t001 (hierarchical) |

**Commands:**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/ready` | Show tasks with no open blockers |
| `/list-verify` | List verification queue (pending, passed, failed) |
| `/sync-beads` | Sync TODO.md/PLANS.md with Beads graph |
| `bd list` | List all tasks in Beads |
| `bd ready` | Show ready tasks (Beads CLI) |
| `bd graph <id>` | Show dependency graph for an issue |

**Architecture:** **[aidevops](https://aidevops.sh)** markdown files (TODO.md, PLANS.md) are the source of truth. Beads syncs from them for visualization.

**Optional Viewers:** Beyond the `bd` CLI, there are community viewers for richer visualization:
- `beads_viewer` (Python TUI) - PageRank, critical path analysis
- `beads-ui` (Web) - Live updates in browser
- `bdui` (React/Ink TUI) - Modern terminal UI
- `perles` (Rust TUI) - BQL query language

See `.agents/tools/task-management/beads.md` for complete documentation and installation commands.

**Your AI assistant now has agentic access to 30+ service integrations.**

### OpenCode Anthropic OAuth (Built-in)

OpenCode includes Anthropic OAuth authentication natively — no API key needed. OAuth is covered by your Claude Pro/Max subscription at zero additional cost.

**Authenticate via the pool (recommended):**

```bash
aidevops model-accounts-pool add anthropic
# Opens browser OAuth flow — no API key required
# Restart OpenCode after adding
```

**Or via the OpenCode TUI:**

Open OpenCode → `Ctrl+A` → Select **Anthropic** → **Login with Claude.ai** → follow browser OAuth flow.

> **Note:** `opencode auth login` prompts for an API key, not OAuth. Use the commands above for subscription-based OAuth access.

**Benefits:**

- **Zero cost** for Claude Pro/Max subscribers (covered by subscription)
- **Automatic token refresh** — no manual re-authentication needed
- **Multiple accounts** — add more accounts to the pool for automatic rotation when one hits rate limits
- **Beta features enabled** — extended thinking modes and latest features

### Cursor Models via Pool Proxy

Access Cursor Pro models (Composer 2, Claude 4.6 Opus/Sonnet, GPT-5.x, Gemini 3.1 Pro) in OpenCode through a local gRPC proxy that translates OpenAI-compatible requests to Cursor's protobuf/HTTP2 protocol.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Add your Cursor account to the pool (reads from local Cursor IDE)
oauth-pool-helper.sh add cursor

# Restart OpenCode — Cursor models appear in Ctrl+T model picker
```

**How it works:**

- Reads Cursor credentials from the local IDE state database
- Starts a gRPC proxy that speaks Cursor's native protocol (not the cursor-agent CLI)
- Discovers available models via gRPC and registers them as an OpenCode provider
- Supports true streaming, tool calling, and automatic token refresh
- Falls back gracefully if no Cursor accounts are in the pool

**Benefits:**

- **Zero additional cost** for Cursor Pro subscribers
- **True streaming** — responses stream as they arrive (not buffered)
- **Tool calling** — Cursor's native MCP tool protocol works through the proxy
- **Model discovery** — automatically detects all models available to your account
- **Pool rotation** — multiple accounts with LRU rotation and 429 failover

### Google AI Pool (Gemini CLI / Vertex AI)

Use your Google AI Pro, AI Ultra, or Workspace subscription for Gemini models. Tokens are injected as ADC bearer tokens that Gemini CLI, Vertex AI SDK, and the Gemini API pick up automatically.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Add your Google account to the pool (browser OAuth flow)
aidevops model-accounts-pool add google

# Restart OpenCode — token is injected as GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

**Supported plans:**

- **Google AI Pro** (~$25/mo) — daily Gemini CLI limits
- **Google AI Ultra** (~$65/mo) — higher daily limits
- **Google Workspace** with Gemini add-on — enterprise daily limits

**Isolation guarantee:** Google auth failures never affect Anthropic/OpenAI/Cursor providers. A Google 429 or auth error only puts the Google pool into cooldown.

### GitHub AI Agent Integration

Enable AI-powered issue resolution directly from GitHub. Comment `/oc fix this` on any issue and the AI creates a branch, implements the fix, and opens a PR.

**Security-first design** - The workflow includes:
- Trusted users only (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR)
- `ai-approved` label required on issues before AI processing
- Prompt injection pattern detection
- Audit logging of all invocations
- 15-minute timeout and rate limiting

**Quick setup:**

```bash
# 1. Install the OpenCode GitHub App
# Visit: https://github.com/apps/opencode-agent

# 2. Add API key secret
# Repository → Settings → Secrets → ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 3. Create required labels
gh label create "ai-approved" --color "0E8A16" --description "Issue approved for AI agent"
gh label create "security-review" --color "D93F0B" --description "Requires security review"
```

The secure workflow is included at `.github/workflows/opencode-agent.yml`.

**Usage:**

| Context | Command | Result |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Issue (with `ai-approved` label) | `/oc fix this` | Creates branch + PR |
| Issue | `/oc explain this` | AI analyzes and replies |
| PR | `/oc review this PR` | Code review feedback |
| PR Files tab | `/oc add error handling here` | Line-specific fix |

See `.agents/tools/git/opencode-github-security.md` for the full security documentation.

**Supported AI tool:** [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) is the recommended and tested AI coding tool for aidevops. All features, agents, and workflows are designed and tested for OpenCode first. We recommend [Claude](https://claude.ai/) models (Anthropic) for the best results across all agent tiers -- haiku for triage, sonnet for implementation, opus for complex reasoning.

**Recommended stack:**

- **[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/)** - The recommended AI coding agent. Powerful agentic TUI/CLI with native MCP support, Tab-based agent switching, LSP integration, plugin ecosystem, and excellent DX. All aidevops features are designed and tested for OpenCode first.
- **[OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/)** - Free tier of OpenCode with included models. Start working with AI straight away at no cost -- no API keys or subscriptions required.
- **[Claude](https://claude.ai/)** (Anthropic) - Our most-used and tested model provider. Claude haiku, sonnet, and opus deliver the best results across all aidevops agent tiers and workflows. Recommended for users who want the highest quality output.
- **[Tabby](https://tabby.sh/)** - Recommended terminal. Colour-coded Profiles per project/repo, **auto-syncs tab title with git repo/branch.**
- **[Zed](https://zed.dev/)** - Recommended editor. High-performance with AI integration (use with the OpenCode Agent Extension).

### Troubleshooting Auth

If you see **"Anthropic Key Missing"**, **"OpenAI Key Missing"**, or the model stops responding, run these commands from any terminal — no working model session required.

**Step 1 — Check pool health**

```bash
aidevops model-accounts-pool status       # counts: available / rate-limited / auth-error
aidevops model-accounts-pool check        # live token validity test per account
```

**Step 2 — Fix based on what you see**

| Symptom | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Account shows `rate-limited` | `aidevops model-accounts-pool rotate anthropic` |
| All accounts in cooldown | `aidevops model-accounts-pool reset-cooldowns` |
| Account shows `auth-error` | `aidevops model-accounts-pool add anthropic` (re-auth) |
| Pool is empty (no accounts) | `aidevops model-accounts-pool add anthropic` |
| Recently re-authed, still broken | `aidevops model-accounts-pool assign-pending anthropic` |
| Google Gemini CLI rate-limited | `aidevops model-accounts-pool rotate google` |
| Google token expired | `aidevops model-accounts-pool add google` (re-auth) |

**Step 3 — If still broken, re-add the account**

```bash
aidevops model-accounts-pool add anthropic     # Claude Pro/Max — opens browser OAuth
aidevops model-accounts-pool add openai        # ChatGPT Plus/Pro
aidevops model-accounts-pool add cursor        # Cursor Pro (reads from local IDE)
aidevops model-accounts-pool add google        # Google AI Pro/Ultra/Workspace — browser OAuth
aidevops model-accounts-pool import claude-cli # Import from existing Claude CLI auth
```

Restart OpenCode after any `add`, `rotate`, or `reset-cooldowns` to pick up the new credentials.

**Full command reference**

```bash
aidevops model-accounts-pool status            # Pool health at a glance
aidevops model-accounts-pool list              # Per-account detail + expiry
aidevops model-accounts-pool check             # Live API validity test
aidevops model-accounts-pool rotate [provider] # Switch to next available account NOW
aidevops model-accounts-pool reset-cooldowns   # Clear all rate-limit cooldowns
aidevops model-accounts-pool assign-pending <p># Assign stranded pending token
aidevops model-accounts-pool remove <p> <email># Remove an account
```

> **Note:** `reset-cooldowns` clears cooldowns in the pool file. If OpenCode is already running, the in-memory token endpoint cooldown is only cleared when OpenCode restarts or when you use the `/model-accounts-pool reset-cooldowns` slash command inside an active session.

**If you prefer guided help:** Open OpenCode with a free model (OpenCode Zen includes free models that don't require any API key or subscription) and run the auth troubleshooting agent by typing:

```
@auth-troubleshooting
```

The agent contains the full recovery flow and symptom table. Free models work fine for this — no paid subscription needed.

### Terminal Tab Title Sync

Your terminal tab/window title automatically shows `repo/branch` context when working in git repositories. This helps identify which codebase and branch you're working on across multiple terminal sessions.

**Supported terminals:** [Tabby](https://tabby.sh/), [cmux](https://cmux.dev/), [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/), [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/), [Hyper](https://hyper.is/), and most xterm-compatible terminals.

**How it works:** The `pre-edit-check.sh` script's primary role is enforcing git workflow protection (blocking edits on main/master branches). As a secondary, non-blocking action, it updates the terminal title via escape sequences. No configuration needed - it's automatic.

**Example format:** `{repo}/{branch-type}/{description}`

See `.agents/tools/terminal/terminal-title.md` for customization options.

**Companion tool:**

- **[claude-code CLI](https://claude.ai/)** - Called from within OpenCode for sub-tasks and headless dispatch

**Collaborator compatibility:** Projects initialized with `aidevops init` include pointer files (`.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, etc.) that reference `AGENTS.md`, helping collaborators using other editors find project context. aidevops does not install into or configure those tools.

**Repo courtesy files:** `aidevops init` scaffolds standard repo files if they don't exist: `README.md`, `LICENCE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. Author name and email are auto-detected from git config. Existing files are never overwritten.

## **Core Capabilities**

**AI-First Infrastructure Management:**

- SSH server access, remote command execution, API integrations
- DNS management, application deployment, email monitoring
- Git platform management, domain purchasing, setup automation
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) management, credential security, code auditing

**Autonomous Orchestration:**

- **[Pulse supervisor](#pulse-supervisor-autonomous-ai-operations)** - Autonomous AI supervisor runs every 2 minutes via launchd — merges ready PRs, dispatches workers, kills stuck processes, detects orphaned PRs, syncs TODO state with GitHub, triages quality findings, and advances missions. No human in the loop
- **[Missions](#missions-multi-day-autonomous-projects)** - Multi-day autonomous projects: `/mission` scopes a high-level goal into milestones and features. The pulse dispatches workers, validates milestones, tracks budget, and advances through the project automatically (`mission-dashboard-helper.sh`)
- **[Multi-model verification](#multi-model-verification-cross-provider-safety)** - Destructive operations (force push, production deploy, data migration) are verified by a second AI model from a different provider before execution. Different providers have different failure modes, so correlated hallucinations are rare
- **Supervisor** - SQLite state machine dispatches tasks to parallel AI agents with retry cycles, batch management, and cron scheduling
- **Runners** - Named headless agent instances with persistent identity, instructions, and memory namespaces
- **`/runners` command** - Batch dispatch from task IDs, PR URLs, or descriptions with concurrency control and progress monitoring

| **proxmox-full** | [ClawdHub](https://clawdhub.com/mSarheed/proxmox-full) | Complete Proxmox VE hypervisor management via REST API |

**CLI Commands:**

```bash
aidevops skill add <owner/repo>    # Import a skill from GitHub
aidevops skill add clawdhub:<slug> # Import a skill from ClawdHub
aidevops skill list                # List imported skills
aidevops skill check               # Check for upstream updates
aidevops skill update [name]       # Update specific or all skills
aidevops skill scan [name]         # Security scan skills (Cisco Skill Scanner)
aidevops skill remove <name>       # Remove an imported skill
```

Skills are registered in `~/.aidevops/agents/configs/skill-sources.json` with upstream tracking for update detection.

**Security Scanning:**

Imported skills are automatically security-scanned using [Cisco Skill Scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner) when installed. Scanning runs on both initial import and updates -- pulling a new version of a skill triggers the same security checks as the first import. CRITICAL/HIGH findings block the operation; MEDIUM/LOW findings warn but allow. Telemetry is disabled - no data is sent to third parties.

When a [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) API key is configured (`aidevops secret set VIRUSTOTAL_MARCUSQUINN`), an advisory second layer scans file hashes against 70+ AV engines and checks domains/URLs referenced in skill content. VT scans are non-blocking -- the Cisco scanner remains the security gate.

| Scenario | Security scan runs? | CRITICAL/HIGH blocks? |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `aidevops skill add <source>` | Yes | Yes |
| `aidevops skill update [name]` | Yes | Yes |
| `aidevops skill add <source> --force` | Yes | Yes |
| `aidevops skill add <source> --skip-security` | Yes (reports only) | No (warns) |
| `aidevops skill scan [name]` | Yes (standalone) | Report only |

The `--force` flag only controls file overwrite behavior (replacing an existing skill without prompting). To bypass security blocking, use `--skip-security` explicitly -- this separation ensures that routine updates and re-imports never silently skip security checks.

Scan results are logged to [`.agents/SKILL-SCAN-RESULTS.md`](.agents/SKILL-SCAN-RESULTS.md) automatically on each batch scan and skill import, providing a transparent audit trail of security posture over time.

## **Agent Sources (Private Repos)**

Sync agents from private Git repositories into the framework. Private repos keep their own agents, helper scripts, and slash commands — `aidevops sources sync` deploys them alongside the core agents.

```bash
aidevops sources add ~/Git/my-private-agents     # Register a local repo
aidevops sources add-remote git@github.com:u/r.git  # Clone and register a remote repo
aidevops sources list                             # List configured sources
aidevops sources sync                             # Sync all sources
aidevops sources remove my-private-agents         # Remove a source
```

**How it works:** Private repos contain a `.agents/` directory with agent subdirectories. Agents with `mode: primary` in their frontmatter are symlinked to the agents root for auto-discovery as primary agent tabs. Markdown files with `agent:` frontmatter are deployed as `/slash` commands. All sources sync automatically during `aidevops update`.

**Reference:** `.agents/aidevops/agent-sources.md`

## **Agent Design Patterns**

aidevops implements proven agent design patterns identified by [Lance Martin (LangChain)](https://x.com/RLanceMartin/status/2009683038272401719).

| Pattern | Description | aidevops Implementation |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Give Agents a Computer** | Filesystem + shell for persistent context | `~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/`, 390+ helper scripts |
| **Multi-Layer Action Space** | Few tools, push actions to computer | Per-agent MCP filtering (~12-20 tools each) |
| **Knowledge Graph Routing** | Indexed, cross-referenced agents instead of isolated skills | `subagent-index.toon` maps 900+ agents by domain, purpose, and dependency — agents discover related context through the graph, not just their own file |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Load context on-demand | Subagent routing with content summaries, YAML frontmatter, read-on-demand |
| **Offload Context** | Write results to filesystem | `.agent-workspace/work/[project]/` for persistence |
| **Cache Context** | Prompt caching for cost | Stable instruction prefixes |
| **Isolate Context** | Sub-agents with separate windows | Subagent files with specific tool permissions |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | Coordinate parallel agents | TOON mailbox, agent registry, supervisor dispatch |
| **Compaction Resilience** | Preserve context across compaction | OpenCode plugin injects dynamic state at compaction time |
| **Ralph Loop** | Iterative execution until complete | `/full-loop`, `full-loop-helper.sh` |
| **Evolve Context** | Learn from sessions | `/remember`, `/recall` with SQLite FTS5 + opt-in semantic search |
| **Pattern Tracking** | Learn what works/fails | `/patterns` command, `memory-helper.sh` |
| **Token-Efficient Serialisation** | Minimise context overhead for structured data | [TOON format](https://github.com/marcusquinn/aidevops/blob/main/.agents/toon-format.md) — 20-60% token reduction vs JSON/YAML for agent indexes, registries, and data exchange |
| **Cost-Aware Routing** | Match model to task complexity | `model-routing.md` with 7-tier guidance, `/route` command |
| **Model Comparison** | Compare models side-by-side | `/compare-models` (live data), `/compare-models-free` (offline) |
| **Response Scoring** | Evaluate actual model outputs | `/score-responses` with structured criteria |

**Key insight**: Context is a finite resource with diminishing returns. aidevops treats every token as precious - loading only what's needed, when it's needed.

See `.agents/aidevops/architecture.md` for detailed implementation notes and references.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Run multiple AI agents in parallel on separate branches, coordinated through a lightweight mailbox system. Each agent works independently in its own git worktree while the supervisor manages task distribution and status reporting.

**Architecture:**

```text
Supervisor (pulse loop)
├── Agent Registry (TOON format - who's active, what branch, idle/busy)
├── Mailbox System (SQLite WAL-mode, indexed queries)
│   ├── task_assignment → worker inbox
│   ├── status_report → coordinator outbox
│   └── broadcast → all agents
└── Model Routing (tier-based: haiku/sonnet/opus/flash/pro)
```

**Key components:**

| Component | Script | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Mailbox | `mail-helper.sh` | SQLite-backed inter-agent messaging (send, check, broadcast, archive) |
| Supervisor | `supervisor-helper.sh` | Autonomous multi-task orchestration with SQLite state machine, batches, retry cycles, cron scheduling, auto-pickup from TODO.md |
| Registry | `mail-helper.sh register` | Agent registration with role, branch, worktree, heartbeat |
| Model routing | `model-routing.md`, `/route` | Cost-aware 7-tier routing guidance (local/haiku/flash/sonnet/pro/opus/grok) |
| Budget tracking | `budget-tracker-helper.sh` | Append-only cost log for model routing decisions |
| Observability | `observability.mjs` plugin | LLM request capture for cost tracking and performance analysis |

**How it works:**

1. Each agent registers on startup (`mail-helper.sh register --role worker`)
2. Supervisor runs periodic pulses (`supervisor-helper.sh pulse`)
3. Pulse collects status reports, dispatches queued tasks to idle workers
4. Agents send completion reports back via mailbox
5. SQLite WAL mode + `busy_timeout` handles concurrent access (79x faster than previous file-based system)

**Compaction plugin** (`.agents/plugins/opencode-aidevops/`): When OpenCode compacts context (at ~200K tokens), the plugin injects current session state - agent registry, pending mailbox messages, git context, and relevant memories - ensuring continuity across compaction boundaries.

**Custom system prompt** (`.agents/prompts/build.txt`): Based on upstream OpenCode with aidevops-specific overrides for tool preferences, professional objectivity, and per-model reinforcements for weaker models.

**Subagent index** (`.agents/subagent-index.toon`): Compressed TOON routing table listing all agents, subagents, workflows, and scripts with model tier assignments - enables fast agent discovery without loading full markdown files.

## **Autonomous Orchestration & Parallel Agents**

**Why this matters:** Long-running tasks -- batch PR reviews, multi-site audits, large refactors, multi-day feature projects -- are where AI agents deliver the most value. Instead of babysitting one task at a time, the supervisor dispatches work to parallel agents, each in its own git worktree, with automatic retry, progress tracking, and batch completion reporting.

### Pulse Supervisor: Autonomous AI Operations

The pulse is the heartbeat of aidevops — an autonomous AI supervisor that runs every 2 minutes via launchd. There is no human at the terminal. It manages the entire development pipeline across all repos registered with `pulse: true`.

**What it does each cycle:**

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Capacity check** | Circuit breaker, dynamic worker slots calculated from available RAM |
| **Merge ready PRs** | Green CI + no blocking reviews → squash merge (free — no worker slot needed) |
| **Fix failing PRs** | Dispatch a worker to fix CI failures or address review feedback |
| **Detect stuck work** | PRs open 6+ hours with no activity → flag or close and re-file |
| **Dispatch workers** | Route open issues to available worker slots, respecting priority and `blocked-by:` dependencies |
| **Advance missions** | Check active multi-day missions, dispatch features, validate milestones, track budget |
| **Triage quality** | Read daily quality sweep findings (ShellCheck, SonarCloud, Codacy, CodeRabbit), create issues for actionable findings |
| **Sync TODOs** | Create GitHub issues for unsynced TODO entries, commit ref changes |
| **Kill stuck workers** | Workers running 3+ hours with no PR are killed to free slots |
| **Detect orphaned PRs** | Open PRs with no active worker and no activity for 6+ hours are flagged for re-dispatch |

**Operational intelligence:**

- **Struggle-ratio** — computes `messages / max(1, commits)` for each active worker. High ratio (>30) with >30 min elapsed and zero commits flags the worker as "struggling". Ratio >50 after 1 hour flags "thrashing". Informational signal — the supervisor LLM decides the action (kill, wait, re-dispatch with more context)
- **Circuit breaker** — prevents cascading failures by tracking success/failure rates and tripping when error rate exceeds threshold
- **Dynamic concurrency** — worker slot count adapts to available RAM, not a hardcoded constant
- **Stale assignment recovery** — tasks assigned to workers that died (no active process, no PR, 3+ hours stale) are automatically unassigned and made available for re-dispatch
- **Priority ordering** — green PRs (free merge) > failing PRs (closer to done) > high-priority/bug issues > active mission features > product repos > smaller tasks > oldest

**The pulse is an LLM, not a script.** It reads issue bodies, assesses context, and uses judgment. When it encounters something unexpected — an issue body that says "completed", a task with no clear description, a label that doesn't match reality — it handles it the way a competent human manager would.

```bash
# Pulse runs automatically via launchd (every 2 minutes)
# Manual trigger:
opencode run "/pulse"
```

**See:** `.agents/scripts/commands/pulse.md` for the full supervisor specification.

### Missions: Multi-Day Autonomous Projects

Missions are the highest-level orchestration primitive — autonomous multi-day projects that break a high-level goal into milestones, features, and validation criteria. The pulse supervisor advances them automatically.

```bash
# Scope a mission interactively
/mission "Redesign the landing pages for mobile-first with A/B testing"
```

**How missions work:**

1. `/mission` scopes the goal into milestones with features and acceptance criteria
2. Each feature becomes a TODO entry tagged `mission:mNNN` with a GitHub issue
3. The pulse dispatches features as regular workers (respecting `MAX_WORKERS`)
4. When all features in a milestone complete, the pulse dispatches a **validation worker** to verify integration
5. Passed milestones advance automatically — the next milestone's features are dispatched
6. Budget tracking pauses the mission if any category exceeds the alert threshold (default 80%)

**Two execution modes:**

| Mode | Workflow | Best for |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Full** | Worktree + PR per feature, standard review flow | Production code, collaborative projects |
| **POC** | Direct commits, skip ceremony | Prototypes, experiments, proof-of-concept |

**Mission state** is tracked in a JSON file committed to the repo. Each pulse cycle reads the state, acts on it, and commits updates — so any session (or the next pulse) can pick up where the last one left off.

**See:** `.agents/workflows/mission-orchestrator.md` for the full orchestrator specification, `.agents/scripts/commands/dashboard.md` for the mission progress dashboard.

### Multi-Model Verification: Cross-Provider Safety

High-stakes operations are verified by a second AI model from a different provider before execution. This catches single-model hallucinations before destructive operations cause irreversible damage.

**When verification triggers:**

| Risk Level | Examples | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | `git push --force` to main, `DROP DATABASE`, production deploy | Blocked unless second model agrees |
| **High** | Force push to feature branch, data migration, secret exposure | Warned, verification recommended |
| **Medium** | Bulk file deletion, config changes | Logged |
| **Low** | Normal edits, test runs | No verification |

**How it works:**

1. `pre-edit-check.sh` screens operations against the high-stakes taxonomy
2. For critical/high operations, `verify-operation-helper.sh` sends the operation context to a second model (different provider than the primary)
3. The verifier independently assesses whether the operation is safe
4. On disagreement, the operation is blocked (critical) or warned (high)
5. All verification decisions are logged for audit

**Why cross-provider?** Same-provider models share training data and failure modes. A Claude hallucination is unlikely to be reproduced by Gemini or GPT, and vice versa. The verification uses the cheapest model tier (haiku-equivalent) — cost is minimal per check.

**Configuration:** Per-repo via `.agents/reference/high-stakes-operations.md`. Opt-out with `VERIFY_ENABLED=false` (not recommended).

**See:** `.agents/tools/verification/parallel-verify.md` for the verification agent specification.

### Project Bundles: Auto-Configuration

Bundles are project-type presets that auto-configure model tiers, quality gates, and agent routing per repo. Instead of manually configuring each project, bundles detect what kind of project you're working on and apply sensible defaults.

**Built-in bundles:**

| Bundle | Auto-detected by | Model default | Quality gates | Agent routing |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| `web-app` | `package.json` + framework markers | sonnet | Full (lint, test, build, a11y) | Build+ default |
| `library` | `package.json` with `main`/`exports` | sonnet | Full + API docs check | Build+ default |
| `cli-tool` | `bin` field in package.json | sonnet | ShellCheck, test | Build+ default |
| `content-site` | CMS markers, `wp-config.php` | haiku | Lighthouse, SEO | Marketing for content tasks |
| `infrastructure` | `Dockerfile`, `terraform/`, `ansible/` | sonnet | ShellCheck, security scan | Build+ default |
| `agent` | `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/` | opus | Agent review, prompt quality | Build+ default |

**Resolution priority:** Explicit `bundle` field in `repos.json` > `.aidevops.json` project config > auto-detection from marker files.

**CLI:**

```bash
bundle-helper.sh detect <repo-path>    # Auto-detect bundle type
bundle-helper.sh resolve <repo-path>   # Show resolved config (with overrides)
bundle-helper.sh show <bundle-name>    # Show bundle defaults
bundle-helper.sh list                  # List all available bundles
```

**See:** `.agents/bundles/` for bundle definitions, `.agents/scripts/bundle-helper.sh` for the CLI.

### Parallel Agents & Headless Dispatch

Run multiple AI sessions concurrently with isolated contexts. Named **runners** provide persistent agent identities with their own instructions and memory.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Headless dispatch** | `opencode run` for one-shot tasks, `opencode serve` + `--attach` for warm server |
| **Runners** | Named agent instances with per-runner AGENTS.md, config, and run logs (`runner-helper.sh`) |
| **Session management** | Resume sessions with `-s <id>` or `-c`, fork with SDK |
| **Memory namespaces** | Per-runner memory isolation with shared access when needed |
| **SDK orchestration** | `@opencode-ai/sdk` for TypeScript parallel dispatch via `Promise.all` |
| **Matrix integration** | Chat-triggered dispatch via self-hosted Matrix (optional) |

```bash
# Create a named runner
runner-helper.sh create code-reviewer --description "Reviews code for security and quality"

# Dispatch a task (one-shot)
runner-helper.sh run code-reviewer "Review src/auth/ for vulnerabilities"

# Dispatch against warm server (faster, no MCP cold boot)
opencode serve --port 4096 &
runner-helper.sh run code-reviewer "Review src/auth/" --attach http://localhost:4096

# Parallel dispatch via CLI
opencode run --attach http://localhost:4096 --title "Review" "Review src/auth/" &
opencode run --attach http://localhost:4096 --title "Tests" "Generate tests for src/utils/" &
wait

# List runners and status
runner-helper.sh list
runner-helper.sh status code-reviewer
```

**Architecture:**

```text
OpenCode Server (opencode serve)
├── Session 1 (runner/code-reviewer)
├── Session 2 (runner/seo-analyst)
└── Session 3 (scheduled-task)
         ↑
    HTTP API / SSE Events
         ↑
┌────────┴────────┐
│  Dispatch Layer │ ← runner-helper.sh, cron, Matrix bot, SDK
└─────────────────┘
```

**Example runner templates:** [code-reviewer](.agents/tools/ai-assistants/runners/code-reviewer.md), [seo-analyst](.agents/tools/ai-assistants/runners/seo-analyst.md) - copy and customize for your own runners.

**Matrix bot dispatch** (optional): Bridge Matrix chat rooms to runners for chat-triggered AI. Each room maintains persistent conversation context via SQLite -- on idle timeout, the session is compacted (summarised) and stored, so the next message resumes with full context.

```bash
# Setup Matrix bot (interactive wizard)
matrix-dispatch-helper.sh setup

# Map rooms to runners (each room = separate session)
matrix-dispatch-helper.sh map '!dev-room:server' code-reviewer
matrix-dispatch-helper.sh map '!seo-room:server' seo-analyst

# Start bot (daemon mode)
matrix-dispatch-helper.sh start --daemon

# In Matrix room: "!ai Review src/auth.ts for security issues"

# Manage sessions
matrix-dispatch-helper.sh sessions list
matrix-dispatch-helper.sh sessions stats
```

**See:** [headless-dispatch.md](.agents/tools/ai-assistants/headless-dispatch.md) for full documentation including parallel vs sequential decision guide, SDK examples, CI/CD integration, and custom agent configuration. [matrix-bot.md](.agents/services/communications/matrix-bot.md) for Matrix bot setup including Cloudron Synapse guide and session persistence.

### Self-Improving Agent System

Agents that learn from experience and contribute improvements:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Review** | Analyze memory for success/failure patterns (`memory-helper.sh`) |
| **Refine** | Generate and apply improvements to agents |
| **Test** | Validate in isolated OpenCode sessions |
| **PR** | Contribute to community with privacy filtering |

**Safety guardrails:**
- Worktree isolation for all changes
- Human approval required for PRs
- Mandatory privacy filter (secretlint + pattern redaction)
- Dry-run default, explicit opt-in for PR creation
- Audit log to memory

### Agent Testing Framework

Test agent behavior through isolated AI sessions with automated validation:

```bash
# Create a test suite
agent-test-helper.sh create my-tests

# Run tests (auto-detects claude or opencode CLI)
agent-test-helper.sh run my-tests

# Quick single-prompt test
agent-test-helper.sh run-one "What tools do you have?" --expect "bash"

# Before/after comparison for agent changes
agent-test-helper.sh baseline my-tests   # Save current behavior
# ... modify agents ...
agent-test-helper.sh compare my-tests    # Detect regressions
```

Test suites are JSON files with prompts and validation rules (`expect_contains`, `expect_not_contains`, `expect_regex`, `min_length`, `max_length`). Results are saved for historical tracking.

**See:** `agent-testing.md` subagent for full documentation and example test suites.

### Voice Bridge - Talk to Your AI Agent

Speak naturally to your AI coding agent and hear it respond. The voice bridge connects your microphone to OpenCode via a fast local pipeline -- ask questions, give instructions, execute tasks, all by voice.

```text
Mic → Silero VAD → Whisper MLX (1.4s) → OpenCode (4-6s) → Edge TTS (0.4s) → Speaker
```

**Round-trip: ~6-8 seconds** on Apple Silicon. The agent can edit files, run commands, create PRs, and confirm what it did -- all via voice.

**Quick start:**

```bash
# Start a voice conversation (installs deps automatically)
voice-helper.sh talk

# Choose engines and voice
voice-helper.sh talk whisper-mlx edge-tts en-GB-SoniaNeural
voice-helper.sh talk whisper-mlx macos-say    # Offline mode

# Utilities
voice-helper.sh devices      # List audio input/output devices
voice-helper.sh voices       # List available TTS voices
voice-helper.sh benchmark    # Test STT/TTS/LLM speeds
voice-helper.sh status       # Check component availability
```

**Features:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Swappable STT** | whisper-mlx (fastest on Apple Silicon), faster-whisper (CPU) |
| **Swappable TTS** | edge-tts (best quality), macos-say (offline), facebookMMS (local) |
| **Voice exit** | Say "that's all", "goodbye", "all for now" to end naturally |
| **STT correction** | LLM sanity-checks transcription errors before acting (e.g. "test.txte" → "test.txt") |
| **Task execution** | Full tool access -- edit files, git operations, run commands |
| **Session handback** | Conversation transcript output on exit for calling agent context |
| **TUI compatible** | Graceful degradation when launched from AI tool's Bash (no tty) |

**How it works:** The bridge uses `opencode run --attach` to connect to a running OpenCode server for low-latency responses (~4-6s vs ~30s cold start). It automatically starts `opencode serve` if not already running.

**Requirements:** Apple Silicon Mac (for whisper-mlx), Python 3.10+, internet (for edge-tts). The voice helper installs Python dependencies automatically into the S2S venv.

### Speech-to-Speech Pipeline (Advanced)

For advanced use cases (custom LLMs, server/client deployment, multi-language, phone integration), the full [huggingface/speech-to-speech](https://github.com/huggingface/speech-to-speech) pipeline is also available:

```bash
speech-to-speech-helper.sh setup              # Install pipeline
speech-to-speech-helper.sh start --local-mac  # Run on Apple Silicon
speech-to-speech-helper.sh start --cuda       # Run on NVIDIA GPU
speech-to-speech-helper.sh start --server     # Server mode (remote clients)
```

**Supported languages:** English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean (auto-detect or fixed).

**Additional voice methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **VoiceInk + Shortcut** | macOS: transcription → OpenCode API → response |
| **iPhone Shortcut** | iOS: dictate → HTTP → speak response |
| **Pipecat STS** | Full voice pipeline: Soniox STT → AI → Cartesia TTS |

**See:** [speech-to-speech.md](.agents/tools/voice/speech-to-speech.md) for full component options, CLI parameters, and integration patterns (Twilio phone, video narration, voice-driven DevOps).

### Scheduled Agent Tasks

Cron-based agent dispatch for automated workflows:

```bash
# Example: Daily SEO report at 9am

**See:** [TODO.md](TODO.md) tasks t109-t118 for implementation status.

## **Requirements**

### **Recommended Hardware**

aidevops itself is lightweight (shell scripts + markdown), but AI model workloads benefit from capable hardware:

| Tier | Machine | CPU | RAM | GPU | Best For |
|------|---------|-----|-----|-----|----------|
| **Minimum** | Any modern laptop | 4+ cores | 8GB | None | Framework only, cloud AI APIs |
| **Recommended** | Mac Studio / desktop | Apple M1+ or 8+ cores | 16GB+ | MPS (Apple) or NVIDIA 8GB+ | Local voice, browser automation, dev servers |
| **Power User** | Workstation | 8+ cores | 32GB+ | NVIDIA 24GB+ VRAM | Full voice pipeline, local LLMs, parallel agents |
| **Server** | Cloud GPU | Any | 16GB+ | A100 / H100 | Production voice, multi-user, batch processing |

**Cloud GPU providers** for on-demand GPU access: [NVIDIA Cloud](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/), [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai/), [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io/), [Lambda](https://lambdalabs.com/). See `.agents/tools/infrastructure/cloud-gpu.md` for the full deployment guide (SSH setup, Docker, model caching, cost optimization).

**Note:** Most aidevops features (infrastructure management, SEO, code quality, Git workflows) require no GPU. GPU is only needed for local AI model inference (voice pipeline, vision models, local LLMs).

### **Software Dependencies**

```bash
# Install dependencies (auto-detected by setup.sh)
brew install sshpass jq curl mkcert dnsmasq fd ripgrep  # macOS
sudo apt-get install sshpass jq curl dnsmasq fd-find ripgrep  # Ubuntu/Debian

# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@domain.com"
```

### **File Discovery Tools**

AI agents use fast file discovery tools for efficient codebase navigation:

| Tool | Purpose | Speed |
|------|---------|-------|
| `fd` | Fast file finder (replaces `find`) | ~10x faster |
| `ripgrep` | Fast content search (replaces `grep`) | ~10x faster |

Both tools respect `.gitignore` by default and are written in Rust for maximum performance.

**Preference order for file discovery:**

1. `git ls-files '*.md'` - Instant, git-tracked files only
2. `fd -e md` - Fast, respects .gitignore
3. `rg --files -g '*.md'` - Fast, respects .gitignore
4. Built-in glob tools - Fallback when bash unavailable

The setup script offers to install these tools automatically.

| [macOS Automator](https://github.com/steipete/macos-automator-mcp) | macOS automation | Per-agent | No |
| [Playwriter](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/playwriter) | Browser with extensions | Per-agent | No |
| [QuickFile](https://github.com/marcusquinn/quickfile-mcp) | Accounting API | Per-agent | Yes |
| [Repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) | Codebase packing for AI context | Per-agent | No |
| [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) | Error tracking | Per-agent | Yes |
| [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) | UI component library | Per-agent | No |
| [Socket](https://socket.dev/) | Dependency security | Per-agent | No |
| [Unstract](https://github.com/Zipstack/unstract) | Document data extraction | Per-agent | Yes |
| [OpenAPI Search](https://openapi-mcp.openapisearch.com/mcp) | Search and explore any OpenAPI spec | Per-agent | No |
| [Cloudflare Code Mode](https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp) | Full Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints via 2 tools) | Per-agent | Yes (Cloudflare) |

**Tier explanation:**
- **Global** - Tools always available (loaded into every session)
- **Per-agent** - Tools disabled globally, enabled per-agent via config (zero context overhead when unused)

**Performance optimization:** MCP packages are installed globally via `bun install -g` for instant startup (~0.1s vs 2-3s with `npx`). The framework uses a three-tier loading strategy: MCPs load eagerly at startup or on-demand when their subagent is invoked. This reduces OpenCode startup time significantly.

### **Quick Setup**

```bash
# Install all MCP integrations
bash .agents/scripts/setup-mcp-integrations.sh all

# Install specific integration
bash .agents/scripts/setup-mcp-integrations.sh stagehand          # JavaScript version
bash .agents/scripts/setup-mcp-integrations.sh stagehand-python   # Python version
bash .agents/scripts/setup-mcp-integrations.sh stagehand-both     # Both versions
bash .agents/scripts/setup-mcp-integrations.sh chrome-devtools
```

### OpenCode LSP Configuration

OpenCode includes [built-in LSP servers](https://opencode.ai/docs/lsp/) for 35+ languages. For aidevops projects that use Markdown and TOON extensively, add these optional LSP servers to your `opencode.json` for real-time diagnostics during editing:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "markdownlint": {
      "command": ["markdownlint-language-server", "--stdio"],
      "extensions": [".md"]
    },
    "toon-lsp": {
      "command": ["toon-lsp"],
      "extensions": [".toon"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Install the servers:**

```bash
npm install -g markdownlint-language-server  # Markdown diagnostics
cargo install toon-lsp                        # TOON syntax validation
```

These catch formatting and syntax issues during editing, reducing preflight/postflight fix cycles.

## **Browser Automation**

8 browser tools + anti-detect stack + device emulation, benchmarked and integrated for AI-assisted web automation, dev testing, mobile/responsive testing, data extraction, and bot detection evasion. Agents automatically select the optimal tool based on task requirements.

|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| ARIA snapshot | ~0.01s | 50-200 tokens | Forms, navigation, interactive elements |
| Text extraction | ~0.002s | Text length | Reading content |
| Element scan | ~0.002s | ~20/element | Form filling, clicking |
| Screenshot | ~0.05s | ~1K tokens (vision) | Visual debugging only |

See [`.agents/tools/browser/browser-automation.md`](.agents/tools/browser/browser-automation.md) for the full decision tree and [`browser-benchmark.md`](.agents/tools/browser/browser-benchmark.md) for reproducible benchmark scripts.

### Device Emulation

Test responsive layouts and mobile-specific behavior using Playwright's built-in device emulation. Supports 100+ device presets with viewport, user agent, touch events, device scale factor, geolocation, locale/timezone, permissions, color scheme, offline mode, and network throttling.

**Common device presets:**

| Device | Viewport | Scale | Touch |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| `iPhone 15` | 393x852 | 3 | Yes |
| `iPad Pro 11` | 834x1194 | 2 | Yes |
| `Pixel 7` | 412x915 | 2.625 | Yes |
| `Galaxy S9+` | 320x658 | 4.5 | Yes |
| `Desktop Chrome` | 1280x720 | 1 | No |

**Emulation capabilities:**

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Device presets** | `devices['iPhone 13']` - viewport, UA, touch, scale |
| **Viewport/HiDPI** | `viewport: { width: 2560, height: 1440 }, deviceScaleFactor: 2` |
| **Geolocation** | `geolocation: { longitude: -74.006, latitude: 40.7128 }` |
| **Locale/timezone** | `locale: 'de-DE', timezoneId: 'Europe/Berlin'` |
| **Color scheme** | `colorScheme: 'dark'` |
| **Offline mode** | `offline: true` |
| **Permissions** | `permissions: ['geolocation', 'notifications']` |
| **Network throttling** | CDP-based Slow 3G / Fast 3G emulation |

**Recipes included:** Responsive breakpoint testing, multi-device parallel testing, touch gesture testing, geolocation-dependent features, dark mode visual regression, and network condition emulation.

See [`.agents/tools/browser/playwright-emulation.md`](.agents/tools/browser/playwright-emulation.md) for complete documentation with code examples.

### Anti-Detect Browser

Open-source alternative to AdsPower, GoLogin, and OctoBrowser for multi-account automation and bot detection evasion.

**Architecture:**

```text
Layer 4: CAPTCHA Solving    → CapSolver (existing)
Layer 3: Network Identity   → Proxies (residential/SOCKS5/VPN per profile)
Layer 2: Browser Identity   → Camoufox (C++ fingerprint injection)
Layer 1: Automation Stealth → rebrowser-patches (CDP leak prevention)
Layer 0: Browser Engine     → Playwright (existing)
```

**Profile Types:**

| Type | Cookies | Fingerprint | Use Case |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Persistent** | Saved | Fixed per profile | Account management, stay logged in |
| **Clean** | None | Random each launch | Scraping, one-off tasks |
| **Warm** | Saved | Fixed | Pre-warmed accounts (browsing history) |
| **Disposable** | None | Random | Single-use, maximum anonymity |

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Setup
anti-detect-helper.sh setup

# Create profile with proxy
anti-detect-helper.sh profile create "my-account" --type persistent --os macos

# Launch (Camoufox with auto-generated fingerprint)
anti-detect-helper.sh launch --profile "my-account" --headless

# Test detection (BrowserScan, SannyBot)
anti-detect-helper.sh test --profile "my-account"

# Warm up profile with browsing history
anti-detect-helper.sh warmup "my-account" --duration 30m
```

**Engine Selection:**

| Engine | Stealth Level | Speed | Best For |
|--------|---------------|-------|----------|
| **Camoufox** (Firefox) | High (C++ level) | Medium | Full anti-detect, fingerprint rotation |
| **rebrowser-patches** (Chromium) | Medium (CDP patches) | Fast | Quick stealth on existing Playwright code |

See [`.agents/tools/browser/anti-detect-browser.md`](.agents/tools/browser/anti-detect-browser.md) for the full decision tree and subagent index.

## **Repomix - AI Context Generation**

[Repomix](https://repomix.com/) packages your codebase into AI-friendly formats for sharing with AI assistants. This framework includes optimized Repomix configuration for consistent context generation.

### Why Repomix?

## **Augment Context Engine - Semantic Codebase Search**

[Augment Context Engine](https://docs.augmentcode.com/context-services/mcp/overview) provides semantic codebase retrieval - understanding your code at a deeper level than simple text search. It's the recommended tool for real-time interactive coding sessions.

### Why Augment Context Engine?

| Feature | grep/glob | Augment Context Engine |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| Text matching | Exact patterns | Semantic understanding |
| Cross-file context | Manual | Automatic |
| Code relationships | None | Understands dependencies |
| Natural language | No | Yes |

Use it to:

- Find related code across your entire codebase
- Understand project architecture quickly
- Discover patterns and implementations
- Get context-aware code suggestions

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Install Auggie CLI (requires Node.js 22+)
npm install -g @augmentcode/auggie@prerelease

# 2. Authenticate (opens browser)
auggie login

# 3. Verify installation
auggie token print
```

### MCP Integration

Add to your AI assistant's MCP configuration:

**OpenCode** (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "augment-context-engine": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["auggie", "--mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**claude-code CLI**:

```bash
claude mcp add-json auggie-mcp --scope user '{"type":"stdio","command":"auggie","args":["--mcp"]}'
```

### Verification

Test with this prompt:

```text
What is this project? Please use codebase retrieval tool to get the answer.
```

The AI should provide a semantic understanding of your project architecture.

### llm-tldr - Semantic Code Analysis

[llm-tldr](https://github.com/parcadei/llm-tldr) extracts code structure and semantics, saving ~95% tokens compared to raw code. From the [Continuous-Claude](https://github.com/parcadei/Continuous-Claude-v3) project.

```bash
# Install
pip install llm-tldr

# CLI usage
tldr tree ./src                    # File structure with line counts
tldr structure src/auth.py         # Code skeleton (classes, functions)
tldr context src/auth.py           # Full semantic analysis
tldr search "authentication" ./src # Semantic code search
tldr impact src/auth.py validate   # What would change affect?
```

**MCP Integration:**

```json
{
  "llm-tldr": {
    "command": "tldr-mcp",
    "args": ["--project", "${workspaceFolder}"]
  }
}
```

| Feature | Token Savings | Use Case |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Structure extraction | 90% | Understanding code layout |
| Context analysis | 95% | Comprehensive code understanding |
| Semantic search | N/A | Finding code by meaning |
| Impact analysis | N/A | Change risk assessment |

See `.agents/tools/context/llm-tldr.md` for complete documentation.

## **Cross-Tool Compatibility**

### Agent Skills Standard

aidevops implements the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard for cross-tool compatibility. Skills are auto-discovered by compatible AI assistants.

**Generated SKILL.md files** in `~/.aidevops/agents/` provide skill metadata following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification). These are discoverable by any compatible tool.

### Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

aidevops is registered as a **Claude Code plugin marketplace**. Install with two commands:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add marcusquinn/aidevops
/plugin install aidevops@aidevops
```

This installs the complete framework: 13 primary agents, 900+ subagents, and 390+ helper scripts.

### Importing External Skills

Import skills from GitHub or ClawdHub using the `aidevops skill` CLI:

```bash
# Import from GitHub (auto-detects format)
aidevops skill add owner/repo

# Import from ClawdHub (skill registry with vector search)
aidevops skill add clawdhub:caldav-calendar
aidevops skill add https://clawdhub.com/owner/slug

# More examples
aidevops skill add anthropics/skills/pdf           # Specific skill from multi-skill repo
aidevops skill add vercel-labs/agent-skills         # All skills from a repo
aidevops skill add expo/skills --name expo-dev      # Custom name
aidevops skill add owner/repo --dry-run             # Preview without changes
```

**Supported sources:**
- GitHub repos (`owner/repo` or full URL) — fetched via `git clone`
- [ClawdHub](https://clawdhub.com) (`clawdhub:slug` or full URL) — fetched via Playwright browser automation

**Supported formats:**
- `SKILL.md` - [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) (preferred)
- `AGENTS.md` - Claude Code agents format
- `.cursorrules` - Cursor rules format (auto-converted)

**Features:**
- Auto-detection of skill format and category placement
- Conflict detection with merge/replace/rename options
- Upstream commit tracking for update detection (`aidevops skill check`)
- Conversion to aidevops subagent format with YAML frontmatter
- Registry stored in `.agents/configs/skill-sources.json`
- Telemetry disabled (no data sent to skills.sh or other services)

**How it differs from `npx add-skill`:**

| | `aidevops skill add` | `npx add-skill` |
|---|---|---|
| **Target** | Converts to aidevops format in `.agents/` | Copies SKILL.md to agent-specific dirs |
| **Tracking** | Git commit-based upstream tracking | Lock file with content hashes |
| **Telemetry** | Disabled | Sends anonymous install counts |
| **Scope** | OpenCode-first | 22+ agents |
| **Updates** | `aidevops skill check` (GitHub API) | `npx skills check` (Vercel API) |

See `.agents/scripts/add-skill-helper.sh` for implementation details.

## **AI Agents & Subagents**

**Agents are specialized AI personas with focused knowledge and tool access.** Instead of giving your AI assistant access to everything at once (which wastes context tokens), agents provide targeted capabilities for specific tasks.

Call them in your AI assistant conversation with a simple @mention

### **How Agents Work**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Main Agent** | Domain-focused assistant (e.g., WordPress, SEO, DevOps) |
| **Subagent** | Specialized assistant for specific services (invoked with @mention) |
| **MCP Tools** | Only loaded when relevant agent is invoked (saves tokens) |

### **Main Agents**

Primary agents as registered in `subagent-index.toon` (13 total). MCPs are loaded on-demand per subagent, not per primary agent:

| Name | File | Purpose | Model Tier |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| Build+ | `build-plus.md` | Enhanced Build with context tools (default agent) | opus |
| Automate | `automate.md` | Scheduling, dispatch, monitoring, background orchestration | sonnet |
| Accounts | `accounts.md` | Financial operations | opus |
| Business | `business.md` | Company orchestration via AI runners | sonnet |
| Content | `content.md` | Content creation workflows | opus |
| Health | `health.md` | Health and wellness | opus |
| Legal | `legal.md` | Legal compliance | opus |
| Marketing | `marketing.md` | Marketing strategy, email campaigns, paid ads, CRO | opus |
| Research | `research.md` | Research and analysis tasks | gemini/grok |
| Sales | `sales.md` | Sales operations and CRM pipeline | opus |
| SEO | `seo.md` | SEO optimization and analysis | opus |
| Social-Media | `social-media.md` | Social media management | opus |
| Video | `video.md` | AI video generation and prompt engineering | opus |

**Specialist subagents** (@plan-plus, @aidevops, @wordpress, Build-Agent, Build-MCP, etc.) live under `tools/` or as `mode: subagent` files and are invoked via @mention when domain expertise is needed. See `subagent-index.toon` for the full listing.

### **Example Subagents with MCP Integration**

These are examples of subagents that have supporting MCPs enabled. See `.agents/` for the full list of 900+ subagents organized by domain.

| Agent | Purpose | MCPs Enabled |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `@hostinger` | Hosting, WordPress, DNS, domains | hostinger-api |
| `@hetzner` | Cloud servers, firewalls, volumes | hetzner-* (multi-account) |
| `@wordpress` | Local dev, MainWP management | localwp, context7 |
| `@seo` | Search Console, keyword research, domain intelligence | gsc, ahrefs, serper, context7 |
| `@dataforseo` | SERP, keywords, backlinks, on-page analysis | (curl subagent) |
| `@domain-research` | DNS intelligence: rDNS, subdomains, CNAMEs (THC + Reconeer) | (API-based) |
| `@serper` | Google Search API (web, images, news, places) | serper |
| `@list-keys` | List all configured API keys and storage locations | (read-only) |
| `@code-standards` | Quality standards reference, compliance checking | context7 |
| `@browser-automation` | Testing, scraping, DevTools | chrome-devtools, context7 |
| `@performance` | Core Web Vitals, network analysis, accessibility | chrome-devtools |
| `@git-platforms` | GitHub, GitLab, Gitea | gh_grep, context7 |
| `@sentry` | Error monitoring, Next.js SDK setup | sentry |
| `@socket` | Dependency security scanning | socket |
| `@security-analysis` | AI-powered vulnerability detection (OSV, Ferret, git history) | osv-scanner, gemini-cli-security |
| `@secretlint` | Detect exposed secrets in code | (Docker-based) |
| `@snyk` | Security vulnerability scanning | (API-based) |
| `@auditing` | Code auditing services and security analysis | (API-based) |
| `@agent-review` | Session analysis, agent improvement (under build-agent/) | (read/write only) |

### **Setup for OpenCode**

```bash
# Install aidevops agents for OpenCode
.agents/scripts/generate-opencode-agents.sh

# Check status
.agents/scripts/generate-opencode-agents.sh  # Shows status after generation
```

### **Claude Marketplace**

aidevops is available in the Claude marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add marcusquinn/aidevops
/plugin install aidevops-all@aidevops
```

**Agent Skills (SKILL.md):** Auto-discovered from `~/.aidevops/agents/` after running `setup.sh`. Compatible with any tool that supports the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification).

### **Continuous Improvement with @agent-review**

**End every session by calling `@agent-review`** to analyze what worked and what didn't:

```text
@agent-review analyze this session and suggest improvements to the agents used
```

The review agent will:
1. Identify which agents were used
2. Evaluate missing, incorrect, or excessive information
3. Suggest specific improvements to agent files
4. Generate ready-to-apply edits
5. **Optionally compose a PR** to contribute improvements back to aidevops

**This creates a feedback loop:**

```text
Session → @agent-review → Improvements → Better Agents → Better Sessions
                ↓
         PR to aidevops repo (optional)
```

**Contributing improvements:**

```text
@agent-review create a PR for improvement #2
```

The agent will create a branch, apply changes, and submit a PR to `marcusquinn/aidevops` with a structured description. Your real-world usage helps improve the framework for everyone.

**Code quality learning loop:**

The `@code-quality` agent also learns from issues. After fixing violations from SonarCloud, Codacy, ShellCheck, etc., it analyzes patterns and updates framework guidance to prevent recurrence:

```text
Quality Issue → Fix Applied → Pattern Identified → Framework Updated → Issue Prevented
```

## **Slash Commands (OpenCode)**

**Slash commands provide quick access to common workflows directly from the OpenCode prompt.** Type `/` to see available commands.

### **Available Commands**

**Planning & Task Management**:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/list-todo` | List tasks with sorting, filtering, and grouping |

| `/sync-beads` | Sync TODO.md/PLANS.md with Beads task graph |
| `/remember` | Store knowledge for cross-session recall |
| `/recall` | Search memories from previous sessions |

Plans are tracked in `TODO.md` (all tasks) and `todo/PLANS.md` (complex execution plans). Task dependencies are visualized with [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads).

**`/list-todo` options:**

| Option | Example | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `--priority` | `/list-todo -p` | Sort by priority (high → low) |

### Ralph Loop - Iterative AI Development

The **Ralph Loop** (named after Ralph Wiggum's persistent optimism) enables autonomous iterative development. The AI keeps working on a task until it's complete, automatically resolving issues that arise.

**How it works:**

```text
Task → Implement → Check → Fix Issues → Re-check → ... → Complete
         ↑                    ↓
         └────────────────────┘ (loop until done)
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Run quality checks iteratively until all pass
/preflight-loop --auto-fix --max-iterations <MAX_ITERATIONS>

# Or run linters directly
.agents/scripts/linters-local.sh
```

**Note:** Store any API credentials securely via environment variables or `.env` files (never commit credentials to version control).

**Key features:**
- Automatic issue detection and resolution
- Configurable max iterations (prevents infinite loops)
- Works with any quality check (linting, tests, builds)
- Detailed logging of each iteration

See `.agents/workflows/ralph-loop.md` for the full workflow guide.

### Full Loop - End-to-End Development Automation

The **Full Loop** chains all development phases into a single automated workflow:

```text
Task Development → Preflight → PR Create → PR Review → Postflight → Deploy
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Start a full development loop
/full-loop "Implement feature X with tests"

# With options
/full-loop "Fix bug Y" --max-task-iterations 30 --skip-postflight
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--max-task-iterations N` | Max iterations for task (default: 50) |
| `--skip-preflight` | Skip preflight checks |
| `--skip-postflight` | Skip postflight monitoring |
| `--no-auto-pr` | Pause for manual PR creation |

The loop pauses for human input at merge approval, rollback decisions, and scope changes.

See `.agents/scripts/commands/full-loop.md` for complete documentation.

### Git Worktrees - Parallel Branch Development

Work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing or switching. Each branch gets its own directory.

**Recommended: [Worktrunk](https://worktrunk.dev)** (`wt`) - Git worktree management with shell integration, CI status, and PR links:

```bash
# Install (macOS/Linux)
brew install max-sixty/worktrunk/wt && wt config shell install
# Restart your shell for shell integration to take effect

# Create worktree + cd into it
wt switch -c feature/my-feature

# Create worktree + start any AI CLI (-x runs command after switch)
wt switch -c -x claude feature/ai-task

# List worktrees with CI status and PR links
wt list

# Merge + cleanup (squash/rebase options)
wt merge
```

**Fallback** (no dependencies):

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-helper.sh add feature/my-feature
# Creates: ~/Git/{repo}-feature-my-feature/ (cd there manually)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-helper.sh list
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-helper.sh clean
```

**Benefits:**
- Run tests on one branch while coding on another
- Compare implementations side-by-side
- No context switching or stash management
- Each AI session can work on a different branch

**Worktree-first workflow:** The pre-edit check now **enforces** worktrees as the default when creating branches, keeping your main directory on `main`. This prevents uncommitted changes from blocking branch switches and ensures parallel sessions don't inherit wrong branch state.

See `.agents/workflows/worktree.md` for the complete guide and `.agents/tools/git/worktrunk.md` for Worktrunk documentation.

### Session Management - Parallel AI Sessions

Spawn new AI sessions for parallel work or fresh context. The framework detects natural session completion points and suggests next steps.

**Completion signals:**

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| PR merged | Branch work complete |
| Release published | Version shipped |
| All tests passing | Quality gates satisfied |
| User says "done" | Explicit completion |

**Spawning options:**

```bash
# Background session (same terminal)
opencode --non-interactive --prompt "Continue with feature X" &

# New terminal tab (macOS)
osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to do script "cd ~/Git/project && opencode"'

# Worktree-based (isolated branch) - recommended
wt switch -c -x opencode feature/next-feature  # Worktrunk: create + start AI CLI
# Or fallback:
# ~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-helper.sh add feature/next-feature
# cd ~/Git/{repo}-feature-next-feature && opencode
```

**Session handoff pattern:**

When ending a session, the AI provides a continuation prompt for the next session:

```markdown
## Continuation Prompt
[Copy this to start a new session with full context]
```

See `.agents/workflows/session-manager.md` for the complete guide.

### Cross-Session Memory System

**"Compound, then clear"** - Sessions should build on each other. The memory system stores knowledge, patterns, and learnings for future sessions using SQLite FTS5 for fast full-text search, with opt-in semantic similarity search via vector embeddings.

**Slash commands:**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/remember {content}` | Store a memory with AI-assisted categorization |
| `/recall {query}` | Search memories by keyword |
| `/recall --recent` | Show 10 most recent memories |
| `/recall --auto-only` | Search only auto-captured memories |
| `/recall --stats` | Show memory statistics |
| `/memory-log` | Show recent auto-captured memories |
| `/patterns {task}` | Show success/failure patterns for a task type |
| `/route {task}` | Suggest optimal model tier for a task |

**Memory types:**

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `WORKING_SOLUTION` | Fixes that worked |
| `FAILED_APPROACH` | What didn't work (avoid repeating) |
| `CODEBASE_PATTERN` | Project conventions |
| `USER_PREFERENCE` | Developer preferences |
| `TOOL_CONFIG` | Tool setup notes |
| `DECISION` | Process, workflow, or policy choices (naming, release cadence, branching) |
| `CONTEXT` | Background info |
| `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION` | System-level architecture (service boundaries, data flow, tech stack) |
| `ERROR_FIX` | Bug fixes and patches |
| `OPEN_THREAD` | Unresolved questions or follow-ups |
| `SUCCESS_PATTERN` | Approaches that consistently work |
| `FAILURE_PATTERN` | Approaches that consistently fail |

**Semantic search (opt-in):**

```bash
# Enable semantic similarity search (~90MB model download)
memory-embeddings-helper.sh setup

# Search by meaning, not just keywords
memory-helper.sh recall "how to optimize queries" --semantic
```

**Pattern tracking:**

```bash
# Record what worked (via memory system)
memory-helper.sh store --type SUCCESS_PATTERN --content "Structured debugging found root cause" --tags "bugfix,sonnet"

# Record what failed
memory-helper.sh store --type FAILURE_PATTERN --content "Blind refactor without tests caused regressions" --tags "refactor"

# Get suggestions for a new task
memory-helper.sh recall "refactor auth middleware" --semantic
```

**Auto-capture:** AI agents automatically store memories using `--auto` flag when they detect working solutions, failed approaches, or decisions. Privacy filters strip `<private>` tags and reject secret patterns.

**CLI usage:**

```bash
# Store a memory
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh store --type "WORKING_SOLUTION" --content "Fixed CORS with nginx headers" --tags "cors,nginx"

# Store auto-captured memory (from AI agent)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh store --auto --content "Fixed CORS with nginx headers" --type WORKING_SOLUTION

# Recall memories (keyword search - default)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh recall "cors"

# Recall memories (semantic similarity - opt-in)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh recall "cors" --semantic

# Show auto-capture log
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh log

# View statistics (includes auto-capture counts)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh stats

# Maintenance
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh validate   # Check for stale entries
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh prune      # Remove stale memories

# Namespaces (per-runner memory isolation)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh --namespace my-runner store --content "Runner learning"
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh --namespace my-runner recall "query" --shared
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/memory-helper.sh namespaces  # List all namespaces
```

**Storage:** `~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/memory/memory.db` (+ optional `embeddings.db` for semantic search, `namespaces/` for per-runner isolation)

See `.agents/memory/README.md` for complete documentation.

### **Installation**

Slash commands are automatically installed by `setup.sh` for both OpenCode and Claude Code:

```bash
# OpenCode commands deployed to:
~/.config/opencode/command/

# Claude Code commands deployed to:
~/.claude/commands/

# Regenerate commands manually:
.agents/scripts/generate-opencode-commands.sh
.agents/scripts/generate-claude-commands.sh
```

Both generators read from the same source (`.agents/scripts/commands/*.md`), ensuring command parity across tools.

### **Usage**

In OpenCode or Claude Code, type the command at the prompt:

```text
/preflight
/release minor
/feature add-user-authentication
```

Commands invoke the corresponding workflow subagent with appropriate context.

### **Agent Lifecycle (Three Tiers)**

User-created agents survive `aidevops update`. Agents progress through tiers as they mature:

| Tier | Location | Purpose | Survives Update |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Draft** | `~/.aidevops/agents/draft/` | R&D, experimental, auto-created by orchestration tasks | Yes |
| **Custom** | `~/.aidevops/agents/custom/` | User's permanent private agents | Yes |
| **Shared** | `.agents/` in repo | Open-source, distributed to all users | Managed by repo |

**Promotion workflow:** Draft agents that prove useful can be promoted to custom (private) or shared (open-source via PR). Orchestration agents can create drafts in `draft/` for reusable parallel processing context.

### **Creating Custom Agents**

Create a markdown file in `~/.config/opencode/agent/` (OpenCode) or reference in your AI's system prompt:

```markdown
---
description: Short description of what this agent does
mode: subagent
temperature: 0.2
tools:
  bash: true
  specific-mcp_*: true
---

# Agent Name

Detailed instructions for the agent...
```

See `.agents/opencode-integration.md` for complete documentation.

```

## **Configuration & Setup**

aidevops is configured through two JSONC/JSON files that control framework behaviour, model routing, quality gates, and user preferences. Both are optional -- sensible defaults apply out of the box.

| File | Purpose | CLI |
|------|---------|-----|
| [`~/.config/aidevops/config.jsonc`](.agents/reference/configuration.md#configjsonc--full-reference) | Framework config: updates, models, safety, quality, orchestration, paths | `aidevops config` |
| [`~/.config/aidevops/settings.json`](.agents/reference/configuration.md#settingsjson--full-reference) | User preferences: onboarding, UI, model routing defaults | `settings-helper.sh` |

**Quick examples:**

```bash
# Disable automatic updates
aidevops config set updates.auto_update false

# Use opus-tier verification for destructive operations
aidevops config set safety.verification_tier opus

# View all current config values
aidevops config list

# Validate config against schema
aidevops config validate
```

**Precedence:** Environment variables (`AIDEVOPS_*`) > config file > built-in defaults. See the **[full configuration reference](.agents/reference/configuration.md)** for every option, type, default, and example.

### Service Credentials

Service-specific credentials (hosting, DNS, Git platforms, etc.) use a separate template system:

```bash
# 1. Copy and customize configuration templates
cp configs/hostinger-config.json.txt configs/hostinger-config.json
cp configs/hetzner-config.json.txt configs/hetzner-config.json
# Edit with your actual credentials

# 2. Test connections
./.agents/scripts/servers-helper.sh list

# 3. Install MCP integrations (optional)
bash .agents/scripts/setup-mcp-integrations.sh all
```

See [.agents/reference/configuration.md](.agents/reference/configuration.md#service-configuration-templates) for details on the template system and credential security.

## **Security & Best Practices**

**Credential Management:**

- Store API tokens in separate config files (never hardcode)
- Use Ed25519 SSH keys (modern, secure, fast)
- Set proper file permissions (600 for configs)
- Regular key rotation and access audits

### Multi-Tenant Credential Storage

Manage multiple accounts/clients per service with isolated credential sets:

```bash
# Create a new tenant
credential-helper.sh create client-acme

# Switch active tenant
credential-helper.sh switch client-acme

# Set credentials for current tenant
credential-helper.sh set GITHUB_TOKEN ghp_xxx

# Per-project override (gitignored)
echo "client-acme" > .aidevops-tenant

# Export for scripts
source <(credential-helper.sh export)
```

**Resolution priority:** Project `.aidevops-tenant` → Global active tenant → Default

See `.agents/tools/credentials/multi-tenant.md` for complete documentation.

**Quality Assurance:**

- Multi-platform analysis (SonarCloud, CodeFactor, Codacy, CodeRabbit, Qlty, Snyk, Gemini Code Assist)
- Automated security monitoring and vulnerability detection
