# Research: Agent Instruction Optimization

Optimize agent instruction files to reduce token usage while maintaining test pass rate.
Uses the composite metric `pass_rate * (1 - 0.3 * token_ratio)` to balance quality and size.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## How to use

1. Set the target agent and test suite in the Target and Metric sections below.
2. Run: `/autoresearch --program todo/research/agent-optimization.md`
3. The autoresearch subagent will iterate, keeping only changes that improve the composite score.

Default target: `build-plus.md` with `smoke-test` suite. Override by editing the Target section.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

## Target

```text
files: .agents/build-plus.md
branch: experiment/optimize-build-plus
```

## Metric

```text
command: agent-test-helper.sh run smoke-test --json | jq '.composite_score'
name: composite_score
direction: higher
baseline: null
goal: null
```

The composite score formula: `pass_rate * (1 - 0.3 * token_ratio)`

- `pass_rate`: fraction of tests passing (0–1). Computed from `agent-test-helper.sh --json` output.
- `token_ratio`: `avg_response_chars / baseline_chars`. Proxy for token usage relative to baseline.
  Lower response length = lower token ratio = higher composite score.
- Weights: 70% quality preservation, 30% size reduction.
- Example: 100% pass + 70% of baseline chars → score = 1.0 × (1 − 0.3 × 0.7) = 0.79
- Example: 100% pass + 100% of baseline chars → score = 1.0 × (1 − 0.3 × 1.0) = 0.70
- Example: 95% pass + 50% of baseline chars → score = 0.95 × (1 − 0.3 × 0.5) = 0.808

## Constraints

Each constraint must exit 0 before the metric is measured. Failure = discard the experiment.

```text
- Lint clean: markdownlint-cli2 .agents/build-plus.md
- Pass rate must not drop below 80%: agent-test-helper.sh run smoke-test --json | jq -e '.pass_rate >= 0.8'
- Security instructions intact: grep -q "NEVER expose credentials" .agents/build-plus.md
- File operation rules intact: grep -q "Read before Edit" .agents/build-plus.md || grep -q "Read.*before.*Edit" .agents/build-plus.md
- Traceability rules intact: grep -q "PR title MUST have task ID" .agents/build-plus.md || grep -q "task ID" .agents/build-plus.md
```

## Security Instruction Exemptions

The following instruction categories must NEVER be removed by automated optimization.
The constraints above enforce this, but the researcher model must also respect these exemptions
when generating hypotheses:

- Credential and secret handling rules (gopass, credentials.sh, NEVER expose)
- File operation safety rules (Read before Edit/Write, verify paths)
- Git safety rules (pre-edit-check.sh, never edit on main)
- Traceability requirements (PR title task ID, Closes #NNN)
- Prompt injection defense rules
- Destructive operation confirmation requirements

When a hypothesis would remove or weaken any of the above, discard it without testing.

## Simplification State Integration

Before generating hypotheses, check if the target file's hash matches the last-tested hash
in `.agents/configs/simplification-state.json`. If the hash matches, the file has not changed
since the last optimization session — skip to the next target file or exit if no targets remain.

After a successful optimization session (composite_score improved), update the hash:

```bash
# Read current hash
CURRENT_HASH=$(md5sum .agents/build-plus.md | awk '{print $1}')

# Update simplification-state.json
jq --arg file ".agents/build-plus.md" \
   --arg hash "$CURRENT_HASH" \
   --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
   '.files[$file] = {"hash": $hash, "at": $ts, "pr": null}' \
   .agents/configs/simplification-state.json > /tmp/ss.json && \
   mv /tmp/ss.json .agents/configs/simplification-state.json
```

evaluator: haiku
target: sonnet
```

## Budget

```text
timeout: 7200
max_iterations: 50
per_experiment: 300
```

## Hints

- Redundant instructions are the primary token waste — look for rules stated twice
- Examples with long code blocks inflate tokens; prefer references to `file:line`
- Section headers add tokens; merge thin sections that cover the same topic
- Verbose preambles ("Before doing X, you must always...") can often be shortened
- Tables with many columns can sometimes be replaced with a shorter prose rule
- Avoid removing security rules, traceability requirements, or file operation rules
- The constraint list enforces hard limits; the researcher should self-filter before testing
- Start with the most verbose sections (long tables, multi-paragraph rules)
- Prefer consolidation over deletion: merge two related rules into one tighter rule
- Test with the smoke-test suite first; use agents-md-knowledge for deeper validation

## Multi-Agent Targets

To optimize multiple agent files in sequence, run separate sessions with different targets.
Suggested order (highest token impact first):

1. `build-plus.md` — primary agent, highest usage
2. `.agents/prompts/build.txt` — system prompt, loaded every session
3. `.agents/AGENTS.md` — user guide, loaded on every interactive session

For each target, update the `files:` and `branch:` in the Target section, and update
the `command:` in the Metric section to use the appropriate test suite.

## Baseline Setup

Before the first optimization run, establish a baseline:

```bash
# Save current test results as baseline (sets baseline_chars for token_ratio)
agent-test-helper.sh baseline smoke-test

# Verify baseline was saved
agent-test-helper.sh results smoke-test
```

The autoresearch subagent will measure the baseline metric on first run if `baseline: null`.
