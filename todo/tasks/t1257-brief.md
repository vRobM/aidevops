# t1257: Add sequential dependency enforcement for t1120 subtask chain

## Origin

- **Created:** 2026-02-19
- **Session:** supervisor:pid:13972 (headless Claude CLI)
- **Created by:** ai-supervisor

- **Commit:** fe9b99fa1e33a026f032d482e577b71b407431c2 — "chore: AI supervisor created improvement task t1257"

## What

Add sequential dependency enforcement for t1120 subtask chain

## Specification

```markdown
- [ ] t1257 Add sequential dependency enforcement for t1120 subtask chain #bugfix #auto-dispatch #self-improvement ~15m model:haiku category:process — t1120.1, t1120.2, and t1120.4 are all eligible for auto-dispatch but have an implicit sequential dependency (extract functions → add adapter → test). Without explicit blocked-by fields, they could be dispatched simultaneously and t1120.2/t1120.4 would fail because t1120.1 hasn't landed yet. Add to t1120.2 and to t1120.4 in TODO.md to prevent wasted dispatch cycles. ref:GH#1964 assignee:marcusquinn started:2026-02-21T03:19:14Z
