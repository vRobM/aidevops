# t1300: Investigate t1165.1 repeated permission_denied_write_operations failures

## Origin

- **Created:** 2026-02-21
- **Session:** supervisor:pid:81818 (headless Claude CLI)
- **Created by:** ai-supervisor

- **Commit:** f2580d3855b5da389ecd081156e9783cb04fe6a6 — "chore: AI supervisor created improvement task t1300"

## What

Investigate t1165.1 repeated permission_denied_write_operations failures

## Specification

```markdown
- [ ] t1300 Investigate t1165.1 repeated permission_denied_write_operations failures #bugfix #auto-dispatch #self-improvement ~1h model:opus category:reliability — Task t1165.1 has failed 3+ times with failure mode 'permission_denied_write_operations' at opus tier. Recent memories show this pattern at 10:45, 11:03, and 11:21 today. Root cause needs investigation — likely a filesystem permission issue in the worktree or container environment. Check: (1) worktree directory permissions, (2) whether the task requires writing to protected paths, (3) if this is a sandbox restriction. Fix the environment or task spec so workers can succeed. ref:GH#2106 assignee:marcusquinn
