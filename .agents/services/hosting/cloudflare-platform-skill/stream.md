# Cloudflare Stream

Hosted VOD and live video — upload, encode, store, deliver, and stream without running your own transcoding stack. Supports TUS/API/URL uploads, direct creator uploads, iframe/HLS/DASH playback, RTMPS/SRT live ingest, `requireSignedURLs`, `allowedOrigins`, webhooks, GraphQL analytics, captions, and watermarks.

**Security:** Use direct creator uploads for end-user content — API tokens must never reach the frontend.
