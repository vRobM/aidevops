# Chapter 3: Platform-Specific Creative Strategies

Each platform has distinct formats, algorithmic preferences, and creative expectations. This chapter covers six platforms — specs, algorithm factors, winning patterns, and cross-platform adaptation.

## 1. Meta (Facebook & Instagram)

> **Full reference**: `ad-creative-platform-meta.md` — formats, specs, copy formulas, testing framework (279 lines).

**Key stats**: Mobile-first (98.5% mobile, 1.7s attention span). Video gets 59% more engagement on Facebook. Instagram: 500M+ daily Stories users, Reels get 22% more engagement, 70% of shoppers use IG for product discovery.

**Signal weights** (descending): Shares > Comments > Saves > Watch time > Likes. Early engagement (first 30 min) critical.

**Creative fatigue**: Same creative shown >3x/week → declining CTR, rising CPM. Rotate 3-5 variations, refresh every 2-4 weeks.

## 2. TikTok

1B+ MAU, 45+ min avg session. FYP is democratic — any content can go viral. **Completion rate is the most important signal**, followed by interactions, captions/hashtags/sounds. Authenticity beats production value. 90% watch with sound on.

### Specs

| Format | Aspect Ratio | Resolution | Duration | Max Size | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| In-Feed | 9:16 (rec), 1:1, 16:9 | 1080x1920 min | 5-60s (9-15s optimal) | 500MB | MP4/MOV/MPEG/3GP/AVI. Ad name 2-40 chars, description 12-100 chars |
| TopView | 9:16 | Full-screen | Up to 60s | - | First on app open, auto-play with sound |
| Hashtag Challenge | - | Banner 1200x675 | Video 3-15s | - | Description 50-100 chars. Optional branded effects/sounds |
| Branded Effects | - | - | - | - | 2D (stickers/filters), 3D (objects), AR |

### Hook Architecture

```text
POV Hook:         "POV: You just discovered the life hack that changes everything"
Relatable:        "That moment when..." / "Anyone else do this?"
Tease:            "Wait for the ending..." / "I can't believe this worked"
Direct Challenge: "Stop scrolling if..." / "Only [group] will understand"
Educational:      "Here's how to..." / "Stop doing this and start doing that"
```

### Creative Strategies

- **Trend participation**: Monitor TikTok Creative Center. Move quickly — trends have short lifespans. Adapt to brand, don't force it.
- **Creator collaboration**: Spark Ads (boost organic creator content), Creator Marketplace. Brief with talking points not scripts.
- **Edutainment**: Quick tutorials, myth-busting, behind-the-scenes. Use text overlays, trending sounds.
- **Testing**: Low production requirements enable rapid iteration. Test hooks/sounds/formats → analyse completion rates → scale winners.

**Benchmarks**: Good completion rate >25%, good engagement rate >8%.

## 3. Google Ads

### YouTube

| Format | Duration | Skip | Billing | Notes |

3-5s: Transition to main content
5s+:  Expanded content for non-skippers
```

**Video length**: 6s = single message, 15s = one key benefit, 30s = problem-solution, 60s+ = storytelling.

## 4. LinkedIn

## 7. Cross-Platform Strategy

### Platform Optimisation Matrix

| Element | Meta | TikTok | Google | LinkedIn | Pinterest | Snapchat |
|---------|------|--------|--------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Aspect Ratio | 1:1, 4:5, 9:16 | 9:16 | Various | 1.91:1, 1:1 | 2:3, 1:1 | 9:16 |

| Hook Timing | 3 seconds | 1 second | 5 seconds | 5 seconds | Immediate | 1 second |

### Modular Creative System

```text
Core Assets (platform-agnostic):
- Hero imagery/video
- Key messaging
- Brand elements
- Call-to-action

Platform Adaptations:
- Aspect ratio variations
- Duration edits
- Format modifications
- Tone adjustments
```

**Production efficiency**: Shoot for multiple aspect ratios from the start. Create master content with safe zones. Plan platform variations before production, not after.

**Creative refresh**: Maintain platform-specific libraries. Plan refreshes based on fatigue data. Cross-pollinate winning concepts. Track universal vs platform-specific learnings separately.
