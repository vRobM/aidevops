## AI Image Generation for Advertising

### Platform Selection

| Platform | Strength | Best for |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Midjourney** | Artistic quality, aesthetic appeal | Concept art, hero images, backgrounds. V6: improved text rendering, photorealism |
| **DALL-E 3** | Prompt adherence, ChatGPT integration | Marketing materials with text, editorial illustrations, product concepts |
| **Stable Diffusion** | Control, customization (open source) | High-volume generation, custom brand-trained models, proprietary pipelines. Key: ControlNet, inpainting, outpainting, img2img, model merging |
| **Adobe Firefly** | Commercial safety, Adobe ecosystem | Lower legal risk (trained on Adobe Stock + public domain). Native: Photoshop Generative Fill, Illustrator, Express |

### Prompt Engineering

**Structure:** `[Subject] + [Action/Context] + [Environment] + [Style/Medium] + [Lighting] + [Camera/Technical] + [Quality Modifiers]`

```text
"A confident professional woman in her 30s presenting to colleagues
in modern glass-walled conference room with city views,
corporate photography style, natural afternoon light,
Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens, f/2.8, highly detailed, 8k, professional color grading"
```

**Key techniques:**

1. **Specificity** — "young professional checking iPhone 15 Pro in minimalist coffee shop, morning light" beats "person using phone"
2. **Style references** — "In the style of [artist]" / "Photographed by [photographer]"
3. **Camera parameters** — body (Canon EOS R5), lens (85mm f/1.4), film stock (Kodak Portra 400), lighting (three-point, golden hour)
4. **Negative prompts** — "No text, no watermarks, no distortion, no extra limbs"
5. **Weight/emphasis** — Midjourney `::` syntax; Stable Diffusion `((important word))`

**Genre templates:**

```text
Product: "[Product] on [surface], [lighting], shallow DOF, commercial product photography, [brand style], 8k, studio lighting"
Lifestyle: "[Person] [activity] in [location], candid, natural lighting, documentary style, authentic emotion, warm tones, 35mm film"
Abstract: "Abstract visualization of [concept], [color palette], [art style], flowing forms, ethereal atmosphere, gallery quality"
```

### Commercial Applications

- **Concept development:** Generate 20-30 visual concepts -> stakeholder review -> refine -> transition to production
- **Ad creative:** Social (backgrounds, lifestyle, A/B variations, seasonal), Display (banners, conceptual imagery, hero images), E-commerce (lifestyle context, seasonal, virtual try-on)
- **Multi-platform:** Generate in 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (Stories/TikTok), 16:9 (YouTube/display), 4:5 (Facebook) simultaneously. Batch via spreadsheet-driven prompt generation.

### Legal and Ethical

- **Copyright:** Ongoing litigation on training data; use AI images as starting points, not final deliverables; document creative process
- **Platform rights:** Midjourney (commercial with paid plans), DALL-E (full commercial), Stable Diffusion (depends on model license), Adobe Firefly (designed for commercial safety)
- **Disclosure:** Meta requires AI disclosure in political ads; emerging requirements across platforms; maintain internal documentation

## Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO)

> For A/B testing methodology and fatigue detection thresholds, see [testing-optimization.md](ad-creative-testing-optimization.md).

### AI-Powered Creative Analysis Platforms

| Platform | Key Capability |
|----------|---------------|
| VidMob | AI element analysis, performance prediction, competitive intelligence |
| CreativeX | Creative quality scoring, element-level analysis, brand compliance |
| Pattern89 | Predictive analytics, audience-creative matching, fatigue prediction |

**Computer vision detects:** face presence, color palettes, object recognition, scene identification, text/logo placement, composition

### DCO Architecture

| Layer | Components |
|-------|-----------|
| Visual | Backgrounds, product imagery, lifestyle shots, illustrations |
| Messaging | Headlines, subheadlines, body copy, CTAs |
| Data | Product feeds, pricing, inventory, promotions |
| Rules | Audience targeting, contextual triggers, business rules, optimization parameters |

**Decisioning examples:**

```text
Audience-based:
  New Visitors -> "Welcome Offer Inside" + "Start Your Journey"
  Cart Abandoners -> "Still Thinking It Over?" + "Complete Your Purchase"
  Past Customers -> "Welcome Back, [Name]" + "See What's New"

Contextual:
  Morning -> energy/productivity imagery | Rainy -> "Cozy up with..." | Mobile -> vertical layout
```

**Workflow:** Upload components -> define rules/combinations -> set optimization goals -> system generates variations -> traffic distributed -> winning combinations scaled -> underperformers phased out

**Multivariate scale:** 5 hooks x 3 backgrounds x 4 product presentations x 3 CTAs = 180 variations. ML identifies winning patterns, auto-calculates statistical significance, shifts budget to top performers.

### DCO Platforms

- **Meta Dynamic Creative:** 10 images/videos, 5 headlines, 5 body texts, 5 CTAs
- **Google Responsive Display:** 15 images, 5 headlines, 5 descriptions, 5 logos
- **Celtra:** Creative management, advanced decisioning, cross-channel
- **Jivox:** Personalization engine, commerce integration
- **Thunder/Salesforce:** Creative automation, CRM integration

### DCO by Vertical

- **E-commerce:** Product catalog sync, real-time pricing, inventory, review scores. Example: user browses Nike Air Max -> ad shows exact shoes + current price + "Still interested?" + "Complete your purchase"
- **Travel:** User searches "hotels in Paris" -> DCO assembles Paris imagery + hotel options for searched dates + "$129/night" + "Only 3 rooms left" + "Book Your Stay"
- **Financial services:** Compliance-approved messaging libraries, real-time rates, personalized loan amounts, credit tier messaging

### Predictive Performance

**Pre-flight:** Historical assets + performance metrics + audience characteristics + platform data -> expected CTR range, conversion probability, engagement predictions, optimal audience matching

**In-flight triggers:** Statistical significance thresholds, performance differentials, cost efficiency thresholds, fatigue indicators

**AI fatigue responses:** Automatic refresh triggers, rotation to backup creative, frequency cap enforcement, audience expansion recommendations

### Measuring DCO

- **Efficiency:** Production time reduction, cost per variation, time to market
- **Performance:** CTR lift vs. static, conversion rate improvement, ROAS, CPA
- **Attribution:** Element-level reporting, holdout testing, incrementality studies, path analysis
