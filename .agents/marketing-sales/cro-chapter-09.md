# Chapter 9: Pricing Page Psychology

Pricing pages are the most scrutinized pages on any site. Presentation psychology often impacts conversion more than any other element.

## Anchoring

First price seen sets expectations for all subsequent prices. **Descending order wins** -- anchor to highest price, making middle tiers feel reasonable:

```text
Enterprise: $299/mo -> Professional: $99/mo -> Basic: $29/mo
```

Ascending anchors to $29; $99 feels 3.4x more. Descending anchors to $299; $99 feels like 67% discount. Optimizely test: descending order increased Professional signups 37%.

**Strikethrough anchors**: only genuine previous prices or MSRP. Competitive anchoring ("Competitors charge $299, we charge $149") must be truthful.

**Annual vs. monthly display**: Show monthly price prominently to maximize monthly signups. Show annual as monthly equivalent ("$79/mo billed annually") to maximize annual conversions. Test both -- annual often wins on transaction value despite fewer conversions.

## Decoy Pricing (Asymmetric Dominance)

A third option designed to make the target option obviously better by comparison. Decoy must be (1) inferior to target, (2) similar in price, (3) clearly worse value.

**Classic example** (Dan Ariely / The Economist): Online Only $59 | Print Only $125 (decoy) | Online+Print $125. With decoy: 84% chose Online+Print. Without: 32%. Revenue per customer: $80 -> $114 (+43%).

**SaaS example** -- goal: sell Pro ($99/mo):

| Plan | Price | Limits |
|------|-------|--------|
| Starter | $29/mo | 10 users, 50GB, email support |
| **Pro** (TARGET) | **$99/mo** | 50 users, 500GB, phone support, analytics |
| Team (DECOY) | $89/mo | 30 users, 100GB, email support |

Team is $10 cheaper than Pro but offers far less -- Pro becomes the obvious value choice.

## Charm Pricing (Left-Digit Effect)

Prices ending in 9/99/95. Left-to-right processing weights the leftmost digit: $3.99 reads as "three-something." MIT/UChicago (2003): identical clothing at $34 (16 sales), $39 (21 sales, +31%), $44 (17 sales).

| Ending | Signal | Best for |
|--------|--------|----------|
| .99 | Sale/value | Retail |
| .95 | Slightly upscale | SaaS ($29.95/mo) |
| .00 | Premium/luxury | Professional services, high-ticket |

Use charm pricing for consumer products, impulse purchases, competitive markets. Avoid for luxury, professional B2B, premium positioning. Apple ($999/$1,999) -- premium + charm at threshold. McKinsey ($100,000/$500,000) -- round numbers only.

## Price Framing

**Time-based**: Break large sums into daily costs. $365/yr = "Just $1/day". $10,000/yr = "Just $27/day -- less than 30 min of an employee's time."

**Unit economics**: $499/mo for 25 users = "Less than $20/user/month"

**Comparative framing**: Professional Photography $2,000 vs DIY ($800 + time + quality) vs Competitors ($3,000–$5,000). Website Security $99/mo vs Data breach ($4.24M avg, IBM) vs Legal fees ($100K+).

**Loss vs. gain framing**: Loss framing typically stronger ("Don't waste $10K/year on inefficient processes" > "Save $10K/year with automation"). Use loss framing for known pain points, security, prevention. Gain framing for new opportunities, aspirational products. Test both -- audiences differ.

## Tiered Pricing

**Optimal tier count**: 3. Too few (1-2) = no segmentation. Too many (5+) = analysis paralysis.

| Naming type | Examples | Perceived value |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Generic | Basic/Standard/Premium | Low-Medium |
| Aspirational | Silver/Gold/Platinum | Higher |
| Niche-specific | Individual/Team/Organization | Highest relevance |

**Highlight the middle tier** (larger card, "Most Popular" badge, different color). Decoy effect makes it the obvious choice; pushes users off lowest tier; leaves Enterprise as upsell path. Highlight highest tier instead when targeting enterprise.

**Feature differentiation mistakes**: too similar (no price-jump justification), too different (gap too large), feature stuffing (30+ features overwhelms).

**Effective value ladder**: Starter ($29/mo): 10 users, 50GB, email, core features. **Pro ($99/mo, MOST POPULAR)**: 50 users, 500GB, phone, analytics, API. Enterprise ($299/mo): Unlimited, dedicated AM, SSO, SLA, custom integrations.

| Pricing model | Pros | Cons |
|---------------|------|------|
| Feature-based | Clear differentiation, predictable revenue | Can feel artificially limited |
| Usage-based | Scales with growth, feels fair | Unpredictable revenue, overage anxiety |
| Hybrid | Best of both | More complex to communicate |

**Annual discount sweet spot**: 15-25%. Below 10% not compelling; above 30% signals desperation. Most successful SaaS: 15-20% (Basecamp ~16%, ConvertKit 20%, HubSpot ~17%). Default to monthly; show savings badge prominently ("Save 20%").

## Enterprise Pricing ("Contact Sales")

Use when: truly custom pricing, ACV $50K+, complex sales, qualification needed, competitive sensitivity. Anti-patterns: haven't figured out pricing, want to seem premium, hiding uncompetitive prices.

| Scenario | Visible price | Contact Sales |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| SaaS ($499/mo) | 47 trial clicks, avg $6K/yr -> $282K | 12 clicks, avg $8.5K/yr -> $102K |
| Enterprise ($25K/yr+) | 8 contacts, avg $32K | 23 contacts, avg $67K |

Mid-market SaaS: showing pricing won. Enterprise: Contact Sales won (qualified out small prospects, enabled larger deals). **Hybrid "Starting at X"**: sets anchor, signals flexibility, reduces sticker shock, qualifies out low-budget prospects.

## Free Trial vs. Freemium

| Model | Strengths | Weaknesses | Use when |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Free trial (7/14/30 days) | Urgency, full product experience, predictable conversion window | Acquisition friction, may not be enough time | Quick time-to-value, short sales cycle |
| Freemium (limited features/usage) | Low friction, viral growth, habit formation | No urgency, support costs, 2-5% avg conversion | Network effects, viral growth, low marginal cost |
| Hybrid (trial of premium + freemium fallback) | Urgency + safety net (Canva model) | Complex to communicate | Best of both worlds |

**Credit card at signup**: CC required = 60-80% fewer signups but 40-60% conversion. No CC = higher volume but 10-15% conversion. Net revenue often higher without CC due to volume.

## Money-Back Guarantees

| Type | Example | Best length |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Time-based | "30-Day Money-Back -- no questions asked" | 30 days (most common, balanced) |
| Conditional | "Double Your Traffic or Your Money Back in 90 days" | 60-90 days (complex products) |
| Satisfaction | "Love it or return it -- for any reason, at any time" | 7-14 days (digital products) |
| Lifetime | "If it ever fails, we'll replace it free" | 365 days+ (durable goods, e.g. Zappos) |

**Placement** (highest to lowest impact): pricing page -> checkout -> product pages -> exit-intent popups. Adding "no questions asked" to a 30-day guarantee: +18% conversions, +2% refund rate (net positive).

**Framing strength**: Weak ("We offer refunds") -> Medium ("30-day money-back guarantee") -> Strong ("Love It or Your Money Back") -> Strongest (add specificity: "full refund within 24 hours -- no questions asked").

Combine multiple trust signals near CTA: secure checkout badge + guarantee seal + shipping policy + review score.
