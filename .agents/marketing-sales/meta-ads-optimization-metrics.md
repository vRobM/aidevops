|----------|------------|
| E-commerce | $10-15 |
| SaaS/B2B | $15-25 |
| Finance | $20-30 |
| Gaming | $8-12 |

```text
CPC = Spend ÷ Clicks = CPM ÷ (CTR × 10)    ← lower via: higher CTR, lower CPM, better relevance
CPA = Spend ÷ Actions = CPC ÷ Conversion Rate ← lower via: lower CPC, higher CVR, better LP/offer
```

## Quality Metrics

### Ad Relevance Diagnostics (Quality, Engagement Rate, Conversion Rate rankings)

| Ranking | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Above Average | Top 35-55% |
| Average | Middle 35-55% |
| Below Average (Bottom 35%) | Warning zone |
| Below Average (Bottom 20%) | Fix immediately |
| Below Average (Bottom 10%) | Serious issue |

### Frequency (`Impressions ÷ Reach`)

| Campaign Type | Warning | Action Needed |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Prospecting | 2.5+ | 3.5+ |
| Retargeting | 4.0+ | 6.0+ |
| Brand Awareness | 3.0+ | 5.0+ |

**Warning signals:** declining CTR, rising CPA, increasing negative feedback.

## Conversion & Revenue Metrics

| Industry | Good CVR | Great CVR |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| E-commerce | 2-4% | 5%+ |
| Lead Gen | 10-15% | 20%+ |
| SaaS Trial | 5-10% | 15%+ |

```text
CVR             = Conversions ÷ Landing Page Views × 100
ROAS            = Revenue ÷ Ad Spend
Breakeven ROAS  = 1 ÷ Profit Margin                      (e.g. 30% margin → 3.33x)
Breakeven CPA   = AOV × Gross Margin %                    (e.g. $80 AOV × 60% → $48)
MER             = Total Revenue ÷ Total Marketing Spend   (cross-channel; better than ROAS for attribution)
CM              = Revenue - COGS - Ad Spend - Variable Costs
CM%             = CM / Revenue × 100
Incremental ROAS = Raw ROAS × Incrementality %            (e.g. 3.0x × 60% lift = 1.8x true value)
```

**Key guidance:** Use MER for cross-channel budget allocation. Use Incremental ROAS for true ROI reporting.
