# Attribution & Measurement

> What Meta reports and what actually happened can be very different. Understanding attribution is critical for making good decisions.

## Attribution Windows

| Window | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| 1-day click | Conservative measurement |
| 7-day click | Standard ecommerce |
| 1-day view | Brand awareness |
| 7-day click, 1-day view | Most campaigns (2026 default) |
| 28-day click (API only) | B2B / high-consideration |

**How to choose:**
- **7-day click, 1-day view** — most ecommerce, 1-7 day consideration cycles
- **7-day click only** — conservative measurement, B2B, comparing to other platforms
- **1-day click only** — direct response, impulse purchases
- **28-day click** — enterprise, long sales cycles

Changing the attribution window affects reporting only — not delivery.

**Set in Ads Manager:** Campaign → Edit → Attribution setting.

## Click-Through vs View-Through

**Click-through:** User clicked your ad then converted. Clear intent, direct path. Misses brand lift and multi-touch.

**View-through:** User saw your ad (no click), then converted later. Captures brand awareness. Can feel inflated; iOS users largely excluded (2024+).

**Post-iOS 14:** ~80%+ of iOS users opt out of tracking. View-through increasingly represents Android/web only. iOS conversion data is modeled, not directly tracked.

**Typical multi-touch journey:** Ad view → ad view → external research → brand search → direct/organic conversion. Did the ads cause this, or would they have bought anyway?

## What Meta Reports vs Reality

Meta's attribution is designed to show Meta ads in the best light.

**Meta over-reports:** Multiple platforms claim the same conversion; view-through may not be causal; post-iOS modeling can over-estimate.

**Meta under-reports:** iOS users not tracked; ad blocker users not tracked; cross-device journeys missed; long purchase cycles exceed window.

**Multi-touch problem:** 1 purchase, 3 platforms (Meta + Google + TikTok) each claiming full credit.

| What Meta Reports | What Likely Happened |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 100 purchases | 70-90 actually from Meta |
| $50 CPA | $55-75 true CPA |
| 3x ROAS | 2-2.5x true ROAS |

**Rule of thumb:** Discount Meta-reported conversions by 10-30%.

## Incrementality Testing

The gold standard for measuring true ad impact.

```
Incrementality = (Test Group Conversions - Control Group Conversions) / Test Group Conversions
```

**Methods:**
- **Geo holdout:** Run ads in one market (e.g., Dallas), not another (Houston). Compare conversion rates.
- **Audience holdout:** 90% test / 10% control. Track conversions in both groups.
- **Platform pause:** Pause all Meta ads for 2 weeks. Revenue drop = Meta's incremental contribution.

**Benchmarks:**

| Campaign Type | Typical Incrementality |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Retargeting (hot) | 20-40% |
| Retargeting (warm) | 40-60% |
| Prospecting (lookalike) | 60-80% |
| Prospecting (broad) | 70-90% |

Retargeting has the lowest incrementality — many of those users would have purchased anyway. Prospecting drives more true net-new revenue.

**When to run:** Before major budget increases, quarterly, when stakeholders question ROI, after strategy changes.

## Lift Studies (Meta's Official Method)

**Conversion Lift:** Randomized control trial measuring additional conversions. Requires $30K+ spend, 2-4 week test, requested via Meta rep or Experiments hub.

**Brand Lift:** Survey-based. Measures awareness, consideration, recall. Best for brand campaigns.

**Key metrics:** Lift %, Incremental Conversions, Incremental ROAS, Cost Per Incremental Conversion.

```
Test Group: 1,000 conversions | Control: 400 | Lift: 150%
Incremental: 600 | Spend: $30K | Cost Per Incremental: $50
```

**Limitations:** Expensive, time-consuming, snapshot only, Meta-conducted (potential bias).

## Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)

Statistical regression analysis of how all channels contribute to revenue. No pixel required; works across channels; accounts for offline impact; long-term view.

**Limitations:** Requires 2+ years of data; expensive; results lag; doesn't capture creative differences.

**Robyn** — Meta's free open-source MMM tool (R-based). Best for $100K+/month multi-channel advertisers. [github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn)

## Third-Party Attribution Tools

| Tool | Focus | Pricing |
|------|-------|---------|
| Triple Whale | Ecommerce, first-party pixel, post-purchase surveys | $129-$279/mo |
| Northbeam | Multi-touch, ML attribution | $500+/mo |
| Rockerbox | Enterprise, TV/offline integration | Enterprise |
| Dreamdata | B2B account-based | $599-$999/mo |
| HockeyStack | B2B/SaaS, intent signals | Custom |

**Must-haves:** First-party tracking (bypasses iOS/cookie issues), CRM integration, survey integration.

**Post-purchase surveys** — simplest attribution: ask "How did you hear about us?" Zero-party data, works despite tracking limits, captures word-of-mouth. Limitation: memory bias, first-touch bias.

## How to Actually Measure Meta Impact

**Use multiple methods — no single source is perfect:**

1. Platform Reporting (directional, inflated, but detailed)
2. Third-Party Attribution (more accurate, still imperfect)
3. Post-Purchase Surveys (direct customer input)
4. Incrementality Tests (true causal impact)
5. Business Metrics (did revenue actually increase?)

**MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio):**

```
MER = Total Revenue / Total Marketing Spend
```

Tracks business-wide efficiency instead of platform-specific ROAS. Reduces attribution arguments, focuses on outcomes.

**Track all three ROAS tiers:**

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Meta-Reported ROAS | Platform-specific (inflated) |
| Blended ROAS | All marketing combined (realistic) |
| True ROAS | After incrementality adjustment |

**Monthly attribution review:** Compare Meta-reported vs third-party vs survey vs CRM conversions. Calculate discrepancy. Use conservative number for planning; platform data for optimization. Track whether discrepancies are growing.

**Quarterly reality check:**
1. If I turned off Meta ads, what would happen? (run holdout test)
2. Are new customers actually coming from Meta? (survey + CRM)
3. Is business growing proportionally to spend?
4. What do best customers say about how they found you?

## Settings Cheat Sheet

| Use Case | Window | Verification |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Ecommerce (1-7 day cycle) | 7-day click, 1-day view | Triple Whale + blended ROAS |
| Lead gen (7-30 day cycle) | 7-day click only | CRM lead-to-customer rate |
| B2B SaaS (30-180 day cycle) | 28-day click (API) | Dreamdata / HockeyStack |
| Brand awareness | 1-day view | Brand lift study + surveys |

## Key Takeaways

1. Platform data is directional, not gospel — use for optimization, not truth
2. Click-through > view-through for conservative measurement (iOS changes make view-through less reliable)
3. Incrementality is the gold standard — run tests quarterly
4. Use multiple measurement methods — cross-reference everything
5. Focus on business outcomes — MER and blended metrics matter more than platform ROAS
