# Self-Improvement

Every agent session — interactive, worker, or supervisor — should improve the system, not just complete its task. This is a universal principle, not specific to any one command.

**Observe outcomes from existing state.** `TODO.md`, `todo/PLANS.md`, and GitHub issues/PRs are the state database. Never duplicate this state into separate files, databases, or logs.

**Signals that something needs fixing** (check via `gh` CLI, not custom state):
- A PR has been open for 6+ hours with no progress
- The same issue/PR appears in consecutive supervisor pulses with no state change
- A PR was closed (not merged) — a worker failed
- Multiple PRs fail CI with the same error pattern
- A worker creates a PR that duplicates an existing one

**Response: create a GitHub issue, not a workaround.** When you observe a systemic problem, file a GitHub issue describing the pattern, root cause hypothesis, and proposed fix. This enters the existing task queue and gets picked up by the next available worker. Never patch around a broken process — fix the process.

**Route to the correct repo.** Not every improvement belongs in the current project. Before creating a self-improvement task, determine whether the problem is project-specific or framework-level:

- **Framework-level** — route to the aidevops repo. Indicators: the observation references files under `~/.aidevops/`, framework scripts (`ai-actions.sh`, `ai-lifecycle.sh`, `supervisor/`, `dispatch.sh`, `pre-edit-check.sh`, helper scripts), agent prompt behaviour, supervisor/pulse logic, or cross-repo orchestration. **Use `framework-issue-helper.sh log` — not `claim-task-id.sh` — to file the issue directly on `marcusquinn/aidevops`.** The fix belongs in the framework, not in the project that happened to trigger it.
- **Project-specific** — route to the current repo. Indicators: the observation is about this project's CI, code patterns, dependencies, or domain logic.

If uncertain, ask: "Would this fix apply to every repo the framework manages, or only this one?" Framework-wide problems go to aidevops; project-specific problems stay local. Never create framework tasks in a project repo — they become invisible to framework maintainers and pollute the project's task namespace.

**How to file a framework issue (GH#5149):** When you detect a framework-level problem, use the dedicated helper — not `claim-task-id.sh` in the current repo:

```bash
# Detect if a problem is framework-level (exit 0 = framework, exit 1 = project)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/framework-issue-helper.sh detect "description of the problem"

# File a framework issue directly on marcusquinn/aidevops (deduplicates automatically)
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/framework-issue-helper.sh log \
  --title "Bug: supervisor pipeline fails when stdin is consumed" \
  --body "Observed in ai-lifecycle.sh phase 3: ..." \
  --label "bug"
```

This is the correct action path for framework issues. Do NOT use `claim-task-id.sh` in the project repo for framework-level observations — that pollutes the project's task namespace and makes the issue invisible to framework maintainers.

**Scope boundary for code changes (t1405, GH#2928).** Separate "observe and report" from "observe and fix". When dispatched by the pulse, the `PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS` env var lists the repo slugs where you may create worktrees and PRs. Filing issues is always allowed on any repo — cross-repo bug reports are valuable. But code changes (worktrees, PRs, commits) are restricted to repos in `PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS`. If the target repo is not in scope, file the issue and stop. The issue enters that repo's queue for their maintainers (or their own pulse) to handle. If `PULSE_SCOPE_REPOS` is empty or unset (interactive mode), no scope restriction applies.

**What counts as self-improvement:**
- Filing issues for repeated failure patterns
- Improving agent prompts when workers consistently misunderstand instructions
- Identifying missing automation (e.g., a manual step that could be a `gh` command)
- Flagging stale tasks that are blocked but not marked as such
- Running the session miner pulse (`scripts/session-miner-pulse.sh`) to extract learning from past sessions
- **Filing issues for information gaps (t1416):** When you cannot determine what happened on a task because comments lack model tier, branch name, failure diagnosis, or other audit-critical fields, file a self-improvement issue. Information gaps cause cascading waste — without knowing what was tried, the next attempt repeats the same failure. The issue/PR comment timeline is the primary audit trail; if the information isn't there, it's invisible.

**Issue quality filter (GH#6508):** Before filing any enhancement or architectural change — whether via `/log-issue-aidevops`, `framework-issue-helper.sh`, or direct `gh issue create` — apply the framework's own principles to the proposal. Ask: (1) Is this addressing an observed failure, or is it preemptive? Preemptive rules for unobserved failure modes are prompt bloat. (2) Does this add a deterministic mechanism where model judgment would work better? (3) If this comes from comparing aidevops to another framework, is the "gap" actually a deliberate architectural choice? The bar for adding guidance is: **observed failure first, then minimal guidance**. Bug reports with clear reproduction steps are exempt — bugs are observed failures by definition.

**Intelligence over determinism:** The harness gives you goals, tools, and boundaries — not scripts for every scenario. Deterministic rules are for things with exactly one correct answer (CLI syntax, file paths, security). Everything else — prioritisation, triage, stuck detection, what to work on — is a judgment call. If a rule says "if X then Y" but there are cases where X is true and Y is wrong, it's guidance not a rule. Use the cheapest model that can handle the decision (haiku for triage, sonnet for implementation, opus for strategy) — but never use a regex where a model call would handle outliers better. See `prompts/build.txt` "Intelligence Over Determinism" for the full principle.

**Autonomous operation:** When the user says "continue", "monitor", or "keep going" — enter autonomous mode: use sleep/wait loops, maintain a perpetual todo to survive compaction, only interrupt for blocking errors that require user input.
