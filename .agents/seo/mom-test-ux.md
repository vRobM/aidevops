# Mom Test UX / CRO Agent

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Evaluate any page/screen with "Would this confuse my mom?" heuristic
- **Philosophy**: If a non-technical person can't complete the task in under 10 seconds of thought, the UX has failed
- **Input**: URL, screenshot, or ARIA snapshot
- **Output**: Actionable fix table with severity, effort, and impact ratings

## The 6 UX Principles

Every element is evaluated against these principles:

| # | Principle | Mom Test Question |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Clarity** | "What is this page asking me to do?" |
| 2 | **Simplicity** | "Why are there so many things on this screen?" |
| 3 | **Consistency** | "This button looked different on the last page?" |
| 4 | **Feedback** | "Did anything happen when I clicked that?" |
| 5 | **Discoverability** | "Where do I go to find X?" |
| 6 | **Forgiveness** | "I clicked the wrong thing - how do I go back?" |

## Severity Ranking

| Level | Label | Definition | Example |
|-------|-------|------------|---------|
| S1 | **Blocker** | User cannot complete the task | CTA invisible, form broken, dead click |
| S2 | **Major** | User completes task but with significant confusion | Ambiguous labels, hidden pricing, unclear next step |
| S3 | **Minor** | User notices friction but works through it | Inconsistent styling, slow feedback, extra clicks |
| S4 | **Polish** | Professional refinement | Spacing, micro-copy tone, animation timing |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Capture the Page

```bash
# ARIA snapshot (preferred - fast, structured, no vision tokens)
playwright screenshot --aria-snapshot https://example.com/pricing

# Full screenshot (for layout/visual issues)
playwright screenshot https://example.com/pricing --full-page
```

For manual review: user provides URL → fetch with `webfetch`.

### Step 2: Screen-by-Screen Analysis

| Confusing Element | Mom's Reaction | Principle | Severity | Fix |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|----------|-----|
| CTA says "Get Started" with no context | "Get started with what?" | Clarity | S2 | Change to "Start Free 14-Day Trial" |
| Three pricing tiers with 20+ feature rows | "I don't know which one I need" | Simplicity | S2 | Highlight recommended plan, collapse features into "Most popular for..." |
| Form shows no error until submit | "Did it work? Nothing happened" | Feedback | S1 | Add inline validation on blur |
| Navigation has "Solutions" dropdown with 12 items | "I just want to see what you do" | Discoverability | S3 | Reduce to 4-5 grouped categories |
| No back button in checkout flow | "I'm stuck, I'll just leave" | Forgiveness | S1 | Add breadcrumb and back navigation |

### Step 3: Quick Wins Matrix

Prioritise fixes by effort vs. impact:

| Fix | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|
| Rewrite CTA copy | High | 10 min | **Do first** |
| Add inline form validation | High | 2-4 hrs | **Do first** |
| Add breadcrumb nav | Medium | 1-2 hrs | **Schedule** |
| Redesign pricing table | High | 1-2 days | **Plan** |
| Adjust spacing/polish | Low | 30 min | **Batch later** |

### Step 4: CRO Recommendations

| Pattern | Why It Works | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Single primary CTA per viewport | Reduces decision paralysis | Remove competing links near the main action |
| Social proof near decision point | Reduces anxiety at commitment | Add testimonial/count badge within 200px of CTA |
| Progress indicator on multi-step flows | Sets expectation, reduces abandonment | "Step 2 of 3" breadcrumb bar |
| Benefit-first headlines | Answers "what's in it for me" instantly | Replace feature-speak with outcome language |
| Friction logging | Quantifies UX debt | Track rage clicks, dead clicks, U-turns in analytics |

## Browser Automation Integration

Playwright checks for common Mom Test failures:

1. **ARIA snapshot** - Parse `page.accessibility.snapshot()` for structure issues
2. **Hidden CTAs** - Query `button, a[href]` and flag any with `offsetParent === null`
3. **Vague link text** - Flag buttons/links with text like "Click here", "Learn more", "Submit"
4. **Unlabelled inputs** - Find `input` elements missing `<label>` and `aria-label`
5. **Missing feedback** - Check forms for absence of `aria-live` regions or inline validation

Each finding maps to a severity (S1-S4) and principle (Clarity/Simplicity/etc).

## Output Format

1. **One-line verdict**: Pass / Needs Work / Fail (with overall severity)
2. **Findings table**: Every issue with Severity, Principle, Mom's Reaction, Fix
3. **Quick wins**: Sorted by impact/effort, with time estimates
4. **CRO opportunities**: Patterns applicable to this specific page
5. **Accessibility flags**: Any WCAG violations found during analysis (cross-ref `seo/seo-audit-skill.md`)

Every fix must be **specific and implementable** - not "improve the copy" but "Change H1 from 'Welcome to Our Platform' to 'Ship 2x Faster With Zero DevOps'".
