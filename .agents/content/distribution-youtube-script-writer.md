# YouTube Script Writer

Generate YouTube video scripts optimized for audience retention. Supports structured outlines, full scripts with pattern interrupts, hook generation, and remix mode (transform competitor videos into unique content).

## Pre-flight Questions

Before writing, work through:

1. What is the single takeaway — and does every section serve it?
2. Why would someone watch past 30 seconds — what tension or promise holds them?
3. What does the viewer already know — where does this video meet them?
4. What would make this indistinguishable from the last 10 videos on this topic — and how do we avoid that?

## Script Structure

```text
HOOK (0-30s)   — Pattern interrupt + promise + credibility. Goal: stop the scroll.
INTRO (30-60s) — Context + roadmap + stakes. Goal: commit viewer to full video.
BODY           — Sections with pattern interrupts every 2-3 min. Goal: deliver value.
CLIMAX         — Payoff the hook's promise. Goal: satisfy initial curiosity.
CTA (final 30s)— Subscribe + next video + comment prompt. Goal: convert to subscriber.
```

### Pattern Interrupts

Insert every 2-3 minutes to reset attention: curiosity gap ("But here's where it gets weird..."), story pivot ("That's what I thought too, until..."), direct address ("Now you might be thinking..."), visual change ([B-roll / graphic / screen change]), tease ahead ("And the third one is the one nobody expects..."), reframe ("But forget everything I just said, because...").

## Hook Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Bold Claim** — surprising statement challenging assumptions | "This $5 tool outperforms every $500 alternative I've tested." |
| **Question** — viewer desperately wants answered | "Why do 90% of YouTube channels never reach 1,000 subscribers?" |
| **Story** — drop into the middle of a compelling story | "Three months ago, I made a video that got 47 views. Last week, it hit 2 million." |
| **Contrarian** — goes against popular belief | "Everything you've been told about YouTube SEO is wrong." |
| **Result** — show end result, then explain how | "This channel went from 0 to 100K subscribers in 6 months. Here's exactly how." |
| **Problem-Agitate** — name pain point, make it worse | "Your thumbnails are costing you views. And the fix isn't what you think." |
| **Curiosity Gap** — partial info that demands completion | "There's one setting in YouTube Studio that 95% of creators never touch. It changed everything for me." |

## Storytelling Frameworks

| Framework | Best for | Structure |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **AIDA** | Product reviews, tutorials | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action |
| **Three-Act** | Documentaries, deep dives | Setup → Confrontation → Resolution |
| **Hero's Journey** | Personal stories, transformations | Ordinary world → Call → Trials → Transformation → Return |
| **Problem-Solution-Result** | How-to, educational | Problem → Failed approaches → Solution → Proof → Implementation |
| **Listicle with Stakes** | "Top X" videos | Hook why list matters → Items N–2 → Item 1 (best last) → Synthesis |
| **Inverted Pyramid** | News, updates | Most important first, context after |
| **Side-by-side** | Comparisons | Feature-by-feature with verdict |

## Workflow: Generate a Script

### Step 1: Gather Context

```bash
memory-helper.sh recall --namespace youtube "channel voice"
memory-helper.sh recall --namespace youtube "audience"
memory-helper.sh recall --namespace youtube-topics "[topic]"
youtube-helper.sh transcript COMPETITOR_VIDEO_ID
```

### Step 2: Generate the Script

> Write a YouTube video script for: [topic]
>
> **Channel voice**: [from memory — formal/casual, humor style, expertise level]
> **Target audience**: [from memory]
> **Framework**: [chosen from table above]
> **Target length**: [X minutes / Y words]
> **Primary keyword**: [from topic research]
>
> Requirements:
> 1. Hook: [formula type] format
> 2. Pattern interrupts every 2-3 minutes
> 3. [VISUAL CUE] markers for B-roll/graphics
> 4. [TIMESTAMP] markers for YouTube chapters
> 5. CTA specific to the content (not generic)
>
> Competitor angles to AVOID: [from topic research]
> Our unique angle: [from topic research]

### Step 3: Retention Checklist

| Checkpoint | Verify |
|-----------|--------|
| First 5 seconds | Stops the scroll? |
| First 30 seconds | Hook complete with promise + credibility? |
| 60-second mark | Viewer knows what they'll get? |
| Every 2-3 minutes | Pattern interrupt present? |
| Midpoint | "But wait" moment to re-engage? |
| Before CTA | Hook's promise fulfilled? |
| CTA | Specific and content-related (not generic)? |

## Workflow: Remix Mode

Transform a competitor's successful video into a unique script with your voice and angle.

```bash
youtube-helper.sh transcript VIDEO_ID > /tmp/source_transcript.txt
youtube-helper.sh video VIDEO_ID
```

**Analyze**: Extract hook formula, storytelling framework, key points, pattern interrupts, CTA approach, and what drove success.

**Remix**: Write a NEW script covering the SAME topic from [new angle], using MY channel voice, adding [new information/perspective], keeping structural elements that worked. No copied phrases or examples.

| Remix mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Same topic, new angle | Different perspective on same subject |
| Same structure, new topic | Apply successful format to different subject |
| Update | Cover what's changed since the original |
| Response | Add your expertise to an existing video |
| Deep dive | Expand one point from a broad video |

## Script Output Format

```markdown
## [Video Title]
**Target length**: [X min / Y words] | **Framework**: [name] | **Primary keyword**: [keyword]
---
### [00:00] HOOK
[Script text with delivery notes]
[VISUAL: description]
### [00:30] INTRO
[Script text]
### [01:00] Section 1: [Title]
[Script text]
[PATTERN INTERRUPT: type and text]
[VISUAL: description]
### [03:00] Section 2: [Title] — [... continue sections ...] — [XX:XX] CTA
[CTA: specific to content, not generic]

## Metadata
**Titles**: [Option 1] / [Option 2] / [Option 3]
**Chapters**: 00:00 - Hook/Intro | 00:30 - Section 1 | 03:00 - Section 2 | ...
**Tags**: [tag1], [tag2], [tag3], ...
```

## Memory Integration

```bash
# Store successful script pattern
memory-helper.sh store --type SUCCESS_PATTERN --namespace youtube-scripts \
  "Script for [topic] using [framework] with [hook type] hook. [X] min, [Y] sections. Response: [feedback]."

# Store/recall channel voice
memory-helper.sh store --type WORKING_SOLUTION --namespace youtube \
  "Channel voice: [casual/formal], [humor level], [expertise positioning]. Phrases: [list]. Avoid: [list]."
memory-helper.sh recall --namespace youtube "channel voice"
```
