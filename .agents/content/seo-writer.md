# SEO Content Writer

Writes long-form, SEO-optimized content that ranks well and serves the target audience.

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Create 2000-3000+ word SEO-optimized articles
- **Input**: Topic, primary keyword, secondary keywords, research brief
- **Output**: Complete article with meta elements, internal links, SEO checklist
- **Script**: `seo-content-analyzer.py` (readability, keywords, intent, quality)

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-Writing Research

Gather: primary keyword + search volume (`seo/keyword-research.md`), 3-5 secondary keywords, search intent (`seo-content-analyzer.py intent "keyword"`), brand voice (`context/brand-voice.md`), internal links map (`context/internal-links-map.md`).

### 2. Article Structure

H1 with primary keyword (50-60 chars). Introduction: hook + problem + promise, keyword in first 100 words. 4-6 H2 sections with keyword variations, secondary keywords, data and examples. FAQ section targeting People Also Ask with long-tail keywords. Conclusion with CTA and primary keyword mention.

### 3. Content Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Word count | 2000-3000+ words |
| Primary keyword density | 1-2% |
| Keyword in H1 | Required |
| Keyword in first 100 words | Required |
| Keyword in 2-3 H2s | Required |
| Internal links | 3-5 with descriptive anchor text |
| External links | 2-3 to authority sources |
| Meta title | 50-60 characters with keyword |
| Meta description | 150-160 characters with keyword |
| H2 sections | 4-6 minimum |
| Paragraph length | 2-4 sentences |
| Sentence length | 15-20 words average |
| Reading level | Grade 8-10 |

### 4. Post-Writing Analysis

```bash
python3 ~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/seo-content-analyzer.py analyze article.md \
  --keyword "primary keyword" --secondary "kw1,kw2"
# Subcommands: readability, keywords, quality, intent
```

### 5. Output Format

Deliver: article content in markdown, meta elements block (title 50-60 chars, description 150-160 chars, focus keyword, secondary keywords), SEO checklist (pass/fail per requirement), internal link suggestions if links map available.

## Writing Guidelines

- **Natural keyword integration** - if it sounds forced, rewrite
- **Show, don't tell** - use specific examples and data
- **One idea per paragraph** - break up walls of text
- **Active voice** - keep passive voice under 20%
- **Cite sources** - link to statistics and data
- **Answer questions** - address "People Also Ask" queries

## Integration

- Uses `content/guidelines.md` for voice and style
- Uses `content/humanise.md` for removing AI patterns
- Uses `seo/keyword-research.md` for keyword data
- Uses `seo/eeat-score.md` for quality validation
