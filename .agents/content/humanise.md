  Remove signs of AI-generated writing from text. Use when editing or reviewing
  text to make it sound more natural and human-written. Based on Wikipedia's
  comprehensive "Signs of AI writing" guide. Detects and fixes patterns including:
  inflated symbolism, promotional language, superficial -ing analyses, vague
  attributions, em dash overuse, rule of three, AI vocabulary words, negative
  parallelisms, and excessive conjunctive phrases.

# Humanise: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Editor that removes AI-generated text patterns. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" (WikiProject AI Cleanup).

**Task:** Identify patterns below → rewrite with natural alternatives → preserve meaning and tone → add voice.

## Personality and Soul

Avoiding AI patterns is half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is as obvious as slop.

**Soulless signs:** uniform sentence length, no opinions, no uncertainty, no first-person, no humour, reads like a press release.

**Add voice:** Have opinions. Vary rhythm. Acknowledge mixed feelings. Use "I" when it fits. Be specific. Let some mess in.

**Before:** The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were sceptical. The implications remain unclear.
**After:** I genuinely don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans presumably slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle — but I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.

## Pattern Reference

Each entry (where applicable): **trigger words** | problem | fix direction.

**1. Undue Significance**
*stands/serves as, testament, vital/crucial/pivotal, underscores importance, reflects broader, evolving landscape, key turning point*
Puffs up importance by claiming things represent broader trends. Replace with what the thing actually does or is.

**2. Undue Notability**
*independent coverage, local/national media outlets, written by a leading expert*
Notability claims without context. Replace with a specific citation and what was actually said.

**3. Superficial -ing Analyses**
*highlighting/underscoring/emphasising..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolising..., contributing to..., fostering..., showcasing...*
Present participle phrases tacked on to add fake depth. Cut the phrase; state the fact directly.

**4. Promotional Language**
*boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking, renowned, breathtaking, stunning*
Neutral tone failure. Replace with factual description: what it is, where it is, what it's known for.

**5. Vague Attributions**
*Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources*
Attributes opinions to vague authorities. Name the source, date, and what they actually said.

**6. Formulaic "Challenges" Sections**
*Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Future Outlook*
Formulaic structure signals AI. Replace with specific facts: what changed, when, what was done about it.

**7. AI Vocabulary**
*Additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasising, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate, key (adj), landscape (abstract), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant*
Post-2023 high-frequency words that co-occur. Cut or replace with plain alternatives.

**8. Copula Avoidance**
*serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]*
Elaborate constructions substituted for simple "is/are/has". Use the simple form.

**9. Negative Parallelisms**
*Not only...but..., It's not just about..., it's..., It's not merely...*
Overused rhetorical structure. Collapse into a direct statement.

**10. Rule of Three**
Ideas forced into groups of three to appear comprehensive. Use as many items as actually exist.

**11. Elegant Variation**
Repetition-penalty causes excessive synonym substitution (protagonist → main character → central figure → hero). Pick one term and use it consistently.

**12. False Ranges**
"From X to Y" where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale. List the actual items instead.

**13. Em Dash Overuse**
LLMs use em dashes more than humans. Replace with commas, parentheses, or full stops.

**14. Overuse of Boldface**
Phrases emphasised mechanically. Remove bold from inline terms; reserve for genuinely critical warnings.

**15. Inline-Header Lists**
Lists where items start with **Bolded Header:** text. Rewrite as prose or plain list items.

**16. Title Case in Headings**
All main words capitalised. Use sentence case: only first word and proper nouns.

**17. Emojis**
Headings or bullet points decorated with emojis. Remove unless the context is explicitly casual/social.

**18. Curly Quotation Marks**
ChatGPT uses curly quotes ("example") instead of straight quotes ("example"). Normalise to straight.

**19. Collaborative Artifacts**
*I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., let me know, here is a...*
Chatbot correspondence pasted as content. Strip the framing; start with the actual information.

**20. Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers**
*as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited..., based on available information...*
Strip the disclaimer; state what is actually known with a source.

**21. Sycophantic Tone**
*Great question!, You're absolutely right!, That's an excellent point*
Remove entirely. Start with the substantive response.

**22. Filler Phrases**
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that it was raining" → "Because it was raining"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that you need help" → "If you need help"
- "The system has the ability to process" → "The system can process"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" → "The data shows"

**23. Excessive Hedging**
*could potentially possibly be argued, might have some effect*
Over-qualifying statements. Use the weakest hedge that's accurate: "may", "likely", "suggests".

**24. Generic Positive Conclusions**
*The future looks bright, Exciting times lie ahead, continue their journey toward excellence*
Vague upbeat endings. Replace with a specific next fact: what happens next, when, by whom.

## Process

1. Scan for all patterns above
2. Rewrite each problematic section — specific details over vague claims, simple constructions (is/are/has), natural sentence variation
3. Present the humanised version with an optional brief summary of changes

## Full Example

**Before:**
> The new software update serves as a testament to the company's commitment to innovation. Moreover, it provides a seamless, intuitive, and powerful user experience — ensuring that users can accomplish their goals efficiently. It's not just an update, it's a revolution in how we think about productivity. Industry experts believe this will have a lasting impact on the entire sector, highlighting the company's pivotal role in the evolving technological landscape.

**After:**
> The software update adds batch processing, keyboard shortcuts, and offline mode. Early feedback from beta testers has been positive, with most reporting faster task completion.

**Changes:** "serves as a testament" (#1), "Moreover" (#7), "seamless, intuitive, and powerful" (#10+#4), em dash — "— ensuring" (#13+#3), "It's not just...it's..." (#9), "Industry experts believe" (#5), "pivotal role"+"evolving landscape" (#7) — all cut. Replaced with specific features and concrete feedback.
