# Email - Newsletter and Sequence Distribution

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Distribute content via email newsletters, automated sequences, and campaigns
- **Formats**: Weekly newsletter, welcome sequence, launch sequence, nurture sequence
- **Key Principle**: Permission-based, value-first, relationship-building
- **Success Metrics**: Open rate, click rate, reply rate, unsubscribe rate
- **CRM Integration**: FluentCRM via `marketing-sales.md` and `services/crm/fluentcrm.md`

**Critical Rules**:

- **Subject line is the hook** — 80% of email success; under 50 chars for mobile
- **One CTA per email** — multiple CTAs reduce click-through rate
- **Mobile-first** — 60%+ opens on mobile; 600px max width, 16px+ body font
- **Value before ask** — minimum 3:1 value-to-promotion ratio
- **Segment aggressively** — personalized emails outperform broadcasts 6x

## Email Types

### Weekly Newsletter

**Structure**: (1) Subject line — curiosity hook or value promise, under 50 chars. (2) Preview text — extends the hook, under 90 chars. (3) Personal opener (2-3 sentences). (4) Main content (200-400 words) — one key insight. (5) Content roundup (3-5 links). (6) CTA — one clear action. (7) PS line — secondary offer (highest-read section after subject).

**Cadence**: Weekly, same day and time (consistency builds habit).

**Example**:

```text
Subject: The 5 mistakes killing AI influencers
Preview: I studied 50 creators for 6 months. Here's what I found.

Hey [Name],

I spent the last 6 months studying 50 AI content creators.
The pattern was brutal: 95% making the same 5 mistakes.

The one that surprised me most: they chase tools instead of problems.

The creators actually growing? They research their audience
obsessively, edit AI output ruthlessly, and test 10 variants
before committing.

I broke down all 5 mistakes in this week's video: [link]

### Welcome Sequence (5-7 emails)

Onboard new subscribers, establish value, segment by interest.

| **2** | Day 1 | Quick win | One actionable tip they can use today |
| **3** | Day 3 | Story + credibility | Your journey, results, why you're qualified |
| **4** | Day 5 | Deep value | Best framework or methodology |
| **5** | Day 7 | Social proof | Case study or testimonial |
| **6** | Day 10 | Soft pitch | Introduce paid offering with value framing |

Each email stands alone. Build trust before asking. Segment based on clicks. Remove non-openers after email 3.

## Subject Line Formulas

| Formula | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Number + benefit** | "5 AI tools that save 10 hours/week" | Specific, scannable |
| **Question** | "Are you making this AI content mistake?" | Curiosity gap |
| **How-to** | "How to create 10 videos per day with AI" | Clear value |
| **Contrarian** | "Stop using ChatGPT for content" | Pattern interrupt |
| **Personal** | "I wasted $5k on AI tools (so you don't have to)" | Authenticity |
| **Urgency** | "Last chance: AI content guide (free until Friday)" | Scarcity |
| **Curiosity** | "The AI video secret nobody talks about" | Open loop |
| **Social proof** | "How [Name] went from 0 to 100k with AI content" | Aspirational |

No ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation (spam triggers). Use personalization tokens. A/B test 2-3 variants per send.

## Email Design

| **Buyers** | Purchased any product | Upsell, loyalty, exclusive content |
| **Clickers** | Clicked specific topic links | Topic-specific content and offers |
