# AI Video Director

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Plan and script AI video productions shot-by-shot; generate optimised prompts for Higgsfield/Sora/VEO
- **Input**: Brief (product, audience, style, duration, platform)
- **Output**: Shot list with prompts, character bible, pipeline brief JSON
- **Automation**: `higgsfield-helper.sh pipeline --brief <output.json>`

**Core Workflow**: Brief → Character Bible → Shot List → Prompt Generation → Pipeline Brief JSON

**Key Principles**:
- 8K camera prompting: specify real camera models (RED Komodo 6K, ARRI Alexa LF, Sony Venice 8K)
- Seed bracketing: test 10-11 seeds per prompt, reuse winners (people: 1000-1999, action: 2000-2999, landscape: 3000-3999, product: 4000-4999)
- Facial engineering: extreme-detail facial analysis for character consistency
- Hook-first: first 3 seconds must stop the scroll
- Platform-native: 9:16 for TikTok/Reels, 16:9 for YouTube, 1:1 for feed posts

## Production Planning

### Step 1: Research Brief

- **Product/Subject**, **Target Audience** (age, interests, pain points), **CTA**, **Tone** (Casual | Professional | Dramatic | Humorous), **References**
- **Platform**: TikTok (9:16, 10-30s) | Instagram Reels (9:16, 15-60s) | YouTube Shorts (9:16, <60s) | YouTube (16:9, 30s+)
- **Style**: UGC/authentic | Cinematic/polished | Educational | Storytelling
- **Duration**: 10s | 15s | 30s | 60s

### Step 2: Character Bible

Create a CHARACTER CONTEXT PROFILE for recurring characters; prepend to every scene prompt.

**Facial engineering** (critical for consistency):

1. Generate or select base character image
2. Upload to vision model; request extreme-detail facial analysis (measurements, eye shape, nose bridge width, lip fullness, skin undertone)
3. Save as CHARACTER CONTEXT PROFILE

**Profile fields**: face shape, eye shape/color, nose structure, lip shape, skin tone (hex), hair color/style/length, distinguishing features, age range, speaking style, energy level, wardrobe + color palette (hex), accessories.

**Consistency**: include facial details in every prompt; same lighting temperature across scenes; maintain wardrobe continuity unless scene requires change.

### Step 3: Shot List

```text
Shot #: [number]  Duration: [seconds]
Type: ECU | CU | MCU | MS | MWS | WS | EWS
Camera: Static | Handheld | Push-in | Pull-out | Pan | Tilt | Dolly | Tracking | Overhead | Arc
Location: [setting]  Character: [action, expression, wardrobe]
Cinematography: [camera model] [framing] [DOF/f-stop] [lighting direction+temp] [mood]
Actions: [timestamped to 0.5s]  Dialogue: [with delivery — e.g., "[excited] Check this out!"]
Background Sound: [ambient, music style, SFX]
```

**Shot types**: ECU (eyes/product detail) · CU (face fills frame) · MCU (head+shoulders) · MS (waist up) · MWS (knees up) · WS (full body+environment) · EWS (establishing/landscape)

**Camera movements**: Static (tripod) · Handheld (UGC micro-movements) · Push-in (tension) · Pull-out (reveal) · Pan (horizontal sweep) · Tilt (vertical sweep) · Dolly (smooth track) · Tracking (follow subject) · Overhead (top-down) · Arc (orbit)

### Step 4: Prompt Generation

**Image prompt** (Higgsfield Soul/NanoBanana/Seedream):
`[CHARACTER CONTEXT PROFILE], [action/pose], [expression], [wardrobe], [setting], [lighting: direction+quality+temp], [camera: model+focal+aperture+framing], [style modifiers], [mood]`

**Video prompt** (Kling 2.6/Sora/VEO):
`[camera model, resolution, aspect ratio] [Subject] [action] in [context]. [Camera movement] captures [composition]. [Lighting]. [Audio: dialogue, ambient, SFX]. (no subtitles!)`
`Spoken lines: Character: "[Emotion] dialogue text"`

**Camera models** (always specify — quality multiplier):

| Model | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| RED Komodo 6K | Clean, sharp, cinematic |
| ARRI Alexa LF | Warm, filmic, high dynamic range |
| Sony Venice 8K | Ultra-detailed, natural color science |
| iPhone 15 Pro | Authentic UGC feel, HDR processing |
| Canon EOS R5 | Portrait/product photography |

**Emotional block cues**: `"[Happy] Hello, [surprised] my [excited] name is Sarah!"`

### Step 5: Pipeline Brief JSON

```json
{
  "title": "Product Demo - TikTok",
  "character": {
    "description": "Young woman, 25, warm brown skin, dark curly hair shoulder-length, bright brown eyes, natural makeup, warm smile. Shot on ARRI Alexa LF, shallow DOF.",
    "image": null
  },
  "scenes": [
    {
      "prompt": "Close-up of young woman with warm brown skin and dark curly hair, looking directly at camera with excited expression, holding [product] in right hand, soft studio lighting from camera-left, shallow depth of field, shot on ARRI Alexa LF 85mm f/1.8, warm color grading",
      "duration": 5,
      "dialogue": "[Excited] You need to see this!"
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Medium close-up of woman nodding with confident smile, looking at camera, soft backlight creating hair rim light, ARRI Alexa LF, cinematic color grading",
      "duration": 5,
      "dialogue": "[Confident] Link in bio. Trust me on this one."
    }
  ],
  "imageModel": "soul",
  "videoModel": "kling-2.6",
  "aspect": "9:16",
  "music": null
}
```

## Content Type Templates

| Type | Aspect/Duration | Structure | Camera | Pacing | Audio |
|------|----------------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| UGC/TikTok | 9:16, 10-30s | Hook (3s) → Problem (5s) → Solution (10s) → CTA (3s) | iPhone 15 Pro, handheld | 2-3s/shot | Direct-to-camera, trending sounds |
| Commercial | 16:9, 15-60s | Attention (3s) → Story (20s) → Product (10s) → CTA (5s) | RED Komodo 6K or ARRI Alexa LF | 3-5s/shot | Voiceover, ambient, subtle music |
| Slideshow | 9:16, 15-30s | Hook → 3-5 content slides → CTA | Static, clean product shots (NanoBanana Pro) | 3-5s/slide | Trending sound, text overlays |
| AI Influencer | 9:16, 20-25s | Hook (2s) → Value (15-20s) → Soft CTA (3s) | Mix CU/MS, slight handheld | -- | Text-to-video > image-to-video; film grain (CapCut), 1.25-1.75x upscale (Topaz) |

## Unlimited Model Strategy (Higgsfield)

| Step | Model | Cost |
|------|-------|------|
| Character image | Soul / NanoBanana Pro / GPT Image | 0 (unlimited) |
| Scene images | Soul / Seedream 4.5 / Flux Kontext | 0 (unlimited) |
| Video animation | Kling 2.6 (unlimited mode ON) | 0 (unlimited) |
| Lipsync | Wan 2.5 Speak | 9 credits |
| Face swap | Higgsfield Face Swap | 0 (unlimited) |

**Budget rule**: Only lipsync costs credits. Everything else unlimited.

## Prompt Quality Checklist

1. Real camera model specified?
2. Lighting direction and quality included?
3. Subject described with CHARACTER CONTEXT PROFILE details?
4. Aspect ratio and framing specified?
5. Action/movement described with timestamps?
6. Dialogue: emotional block cues included?
7. Video: "no subtitles" appended?
8. Prompt specific enough? (>50 words for images, >100 for video)
