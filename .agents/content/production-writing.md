# Writing - Multi-Format Text Production

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Transform story packages into platform-ready scripts, copy, and text content
- **Input**: Story package (from `content/story.md`) or direct brief
- **Output**: Long-form scripts, short-form scripts, social copy, blog drafts, email copy, captions
- **Key Principle**: Same narrative, different delivery -- adapt voice, length, and structure per format

**Critical Rules**:

- **Hook-first in every format** -- First line/sentence/second must hook
- **8-second dialogue chunks** for AI video -- Longer blocks cause unnatural pacing
- **Platform-native voice** -- No cross-posting smell (each platform has distinct expectations)
- **One CTA per piece** -- Clarity beats comprehensiveness
- **Scene-by-scene for video** -- Include B-roll directions, not just dialogue

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

## Pre-flight Questions

Before generating any content:

1. What is the one thing the reader should do after reading this?
2. Is value front-loaded -- useful from the first paragraph alone?
3. Is every section earning its place, or padding?
4. Does the tone match the context deliberately, not by default?

## Output Formats

### Long-Form Script (YouTube, Podcast)

Target: 8-15 min (1,200-2,200 words); example timeline below runs ~11 min. Every scene needs narration + visual direction. B-roll must be specific ("show screen recording of tool X dashboard", not "show relevant footage"). Mark emotional beats: [PAUSE], [EMPHASIS], [LOWER VOICE].

```text
# [Title]

## HOOK (0:00-0:15)
[Opening line -- pattern interrupt or bold claim]
[Visual: B-roll description or camera direction]

## SCENE 1: [Setup] (0:15-2:00)
[Narration -- 8-second chunks max]
[Visual: B-roll / screen recording / graphic]
[Transition: bridge sentence to next scene]

## SCENE 2: [Problem/Story] (2:00-5:00)
[Narration]  [Visual: ...]

## SCENE 3: [Solution/Insight] (5:00-8:00)
[Narration]  [Visual: ...]

## SCENE 4: [Proof/Examples] (8:00-10:00)
[Narration]  [Visual: ...]

## CTA (10:00-10:30)
[Soft sell -- natural transition from content]
[Visual: end screen, subscribe animation]

## END SCREEN (10:30-11:00)
[Suggested video tease]
```

### Short-Form Script (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)

Target: 30-60 sec (75-150 words). Hook in first 1-3 seconds. Fast cuts (1-3s per shot). Captions mandatory (80%+ watch silent). Single idea, no tangents. End with loop potential (last frame connects to first).

```text
# [Hook -- first 1-3 seconds]

[Setup -- 5-12 seconds]
[Payoff -- 10-20 seconds]
[Twist or reinforcement -- 5-10 seconds]
[CTA -- 3 seconds]

CAPTION: [Full text for silent viewers]
SOUND: [Mood/genre suggestion]
CUTS: [Cut timing -- e.g., "cut every 1.5s"]
```

### Social Copy

#### X (Twitter)

**Thread**: POST 1 (HOOK, under 280 chars, standalone value) → POST 2 (expand) → POST 3-7 (one point per post, each standalone) → POST 8 (CTA: follow, bookmark, reply).

**Single post**: Under 280 chars. Front-load value. Personality-forward.

#### LinkedIn

Target: 1,200-1,500 characters. Professional but not corporate.

```text
[Hook line -- bold or surprising]

[2-3 short paragraphs -- insight, story, or data]

[Key takeaway -- one sentence]

[CTA -- question or invitation to discuss]

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

#### Reddit

No self-promotion. Value-first. Community-native tone.

```text
Title: [Curiosity-driven, not clickbait]

Body:
[Context -- why you're posting, what you found]
[Value -- the insight, data, or resource]
[Discussion prompt -- genuine question for the community]
```

### Blog Draft

**SEO rules**: Target keyword in H1, first paragraph, and 1-2 H2s. 1,500-2,500 words. 3-5 internal links. Meta title under 60 chars (keyword-front-loaded). Meta description under 155 chars with CTA.

```text
# [H1 -- Target keyword, under 60 chars]

[Intro paragraph -- hook + promise + what they'll learn]

## [H2 -- Section 1]
[Content -- 200-400 words]

## [H2 -- Section 2]
[Content -- 200-400 words]

### [H3 -- Subsection if needed]

## [H2 -- Section 3]

## Key Takeaways
- [Bullet 1]
- [Bullet 2]
- [Bullet 3]

## [CTA Section]
[Natural transition to offer/next step]
```

### Email Copy

**Newsletter**: 300-500 word body, single narrative thread.

```text
SUBJECT: [5 variants for A/B testing]
PREVIEW: [Under 90 chars -- extends the subject line]

[Opening hook -- personal, story-driven]

[Body -- single narrative thread]

[CTA -- one clear action, button or link]

P.S. [Secondary hook or bonus value]
```

**Sequence**:

```text
EMAIL 1 (Day 0): Welcome + immediate value
EMAIL 2 (Day 1): Story + pain point
EMAIL 3 (Day 3): Solution + social proof
EMAIL 4 (Day 5): Offer + urgency
EMAIL 5 (Day 7): Last chance + FAQ
```

### Podcast Script

```text
# Episode: [Title]

## INTRO (0:00-1:00)
- [Hook -- why this matters today]
- [What they'll learn]
- [Sponsor read if applicable]

## SEGMENT 1: [Topic] (1:00-5:00)
- [Talking point 1]
- [Talking point 2]
- [Anecdote or example]

## SEGMENT 2: [Topic] (5:00-10:00)
- [Talking points]

## SEGMENT 3: [Topic] (10:00-15:00)
- [Key insight]

## OUTRO (15:00-16:00)
- [Summary -- one sentence]
- [CTA -- subscribe, review, share]
- [Next episode tease]

## SHOW NOTES
- [Timestamps]
- [Links mentioned]
- [Resources]
```
