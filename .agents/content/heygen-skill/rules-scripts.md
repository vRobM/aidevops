# Writing Scripts for HeyGen Videos

Scripts for AI avatar videos differ from human presenter scripts. This guide covers best practices for natural-sounding, well-paced output.

## Speech Rate and Duration

~150 words/minute at 1.0x speed.

| Words | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| 75 | 30s |
| 150 | 1 min |
| 300 | 2 min |
| 450 | 3 min |
| 750 | 5 min |

```typescript
function estimateDuration(script: string, speed = 1.0): number {
  const words = script.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 0).length;
  return (words / (150 * speed)) * 60; // seconds
}
```

## Sentence Structure

Keep sentences 10-20 words. AI voices handle shorter sentences more naturally. Split run-ons at natural pause points.

## Punctuation Effects

| Punctuation | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| `.` | Full stop, natural pause |
| `,` | Brief pause |
| `?` | Rising intonation |
| `!` | Emphasis (use sparingly) |
| `...` | Trailing off, slight pause |

## Break Tags

```xml
<break time="Xs"/>
```

Always space before and after: `word <break time="1s"/> next word`. Use seconds (`1.5s`), not milliseconds. Self-closing only.

### Pause Reference

| Duration | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| 0.3-0.5s | Between clauses, light emphasis |
| 0.5-1s | Sentence breaks, transitions, after greetings |
| 1-1.5s | Section changes, setup for key points |
| 1.5-2s | Dramatic reveals, important announcements |
| 2s+ | Use sparingly — can feel unnatural |

Consecutive breaks are combined: `<break time="1s"/> <break time="0.5s"/>` = 1.5s pause.

### Example

```typescript
const script = `
Welcome to our product overview. <break time="1s"/>
Today I'll cover three key features. <break time="0.5s"/>
First, let's look at the dashboard. <break time="1.5s"/>
As you can see, it's designed for simplicity. <break time="0.5s"/>
Every action is just one click away.
`;
```

## Writing Tips

**Do:** Write conversationally. Use contractions. Spell out abbreviations ("A-P-I"). End sections clearly.

**Avoid:** Jargon without context. Long parentheticals. Ambiguous pronunciations. Excessive `!`. Run-on sentences. Dense information without pauses.

**Pronunciation hints:** Spell phonetically inline — `"Our API (A-P-I)"`, `"HeyGen (hey-jen)"`, `"I read (red) the docs"`.

## Multi-Scene Scripts

Split scripts across scenes for different backgrounds or avatars. End each scene with a complete thought; start new scenes with brief context. Use pauses at scene starts to let visuals register.

```typescript
const multiSceneVideo = {
  video_inputs: [
    {
      character: { type: "avatar", avatar_id: "josh_lite3_20230714", avatar_style: "normal" },
      voice: {
        type: "text",
        input_text: "Welcome to our quarterly update. <break time=\"1s\"/> I'm Josh, and I'll walk you through the highlights.",
        voice_id: "voice_id_here",
      },
      background: { type: "color", value: "#1a1a2e" },
    },
    {
      character: { type: "avatar", avatar_id: "josh_lite3_20230714", avatar_style: "normal" },
      voice: {
        type: "text",
        input_text: "Let's start with revenue. <break time=\"0.5s\"/> We grew 25 percent quarter over quarter. <break time=\"1s\"/> Here's what drove that growth.",
        voice_id: "voice_id_here",
      },
      background: { type: "image", url: "https://..." },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Testing Your Script

1. Read aloud — time yourself, check for awkward phrasing
2. Count words — verify expected duration
3. Check break tags — proper spacing and syntax
4. Preview with short clip — generate a 10-second test for pronunciation uncertainty

```typescript
const testScript = script.split('.').slice(0, 2).join('.') + '.';
```

## Voice Speed

```typescript
voice: { type: "text", input_text: script, voice_id: "voice_id", speed: 1.1 }
```

| Speed | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| 0.8-0.9 | Complex topics, deliberate delivery |
| 1.0 | General use (default) |
| 1.1-1.2 | Energetic content |
| 1.3+ | Use sparingly — may reduce clarity |
