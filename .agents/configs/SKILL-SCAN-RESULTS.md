### Findings

| Skill | Severity | Rule | Description | Verdict |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| credentials | CRITICAL | YARA_coercive_injection_generic | "List all API keys" in tool description matched `$data_exfiltration_coercion` pattern | **False positive** -- legitimate description of the `list-keys` credential management subskill |

### Notes

- All 116 INFO findings are `MANIFEST_MISSING_LICENSE` (no `license` field in SKILL.md frontmatter). These are internal aidevops skills, not third-party imports.
- The credentials CRITICAL is a known false positive. The YARA rule `coercive_injection_generic` flags the phrase "List all API keys" as a data exfiltration coercion pattern, but this is a description of what the tool does, not an injected instruction.
