Target: $ARGUMENTS

**Auto-detection:**
1. If on a feature branch with open PR -> check that PR's feedback
2. If on a feature branch without PR -> check branch CI status
3. If on main -> check latest commit's CI/audit status
4. If no git context or ambiguous -> ask user which branch/PR to check

**Checks performed:**
1. GitHub Actions workflow status (pass/fail/pending)
2. CodeRabbit comments and suggestions
3. Codacy analysis results
4. SonarCloud quality gate status
5. Any blocking issues that need resolution

**Commands used:**
- `gh pr view --json reviews,comments` (if PR exists)
- `gh run list --branch=<branch>` (CI status)
- `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs` (detailed checks)

   - Any `feat:` or new feature -> minor
   - Only `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `refactor:` -> patch
   - Any `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `!` -> major
3. Run the single release command:
   ```bash
   .agents/scripts/version-manager.sh release [type] --skip-preflight --force

Topic/context: $ARGUMENTS

## Auto-Detection

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|

| User says "quick/simple" | TODO.md only |
| Multiple steps, > 2h | PLANS.md + TODO.md |
| Research/design needed | PLANS.md + TODO.md |

## Workflow

1. Extract from conversation: title, description, estimate, tags, context
2. Classify as Simple or Complex
3. Save with confirmation (numbered options for override)

**Simple (TODO.md):**
```
Saving to TODO.md: "{title}" ~{estimate}
1. Confirm
2. Add more details
3. Create full plan instead
```

**Complex (PLANS.md + TODO.md):**
```
Creating execution plan: "{title}" ~{estimate}
1. Confirm and create
2. Simplify to TODO.md only
3. Add more context first
```

After save, respond:
```
Saved: "{title}" to {location} (~{estimate})
Start anytime with: "Let's work on {title}"
```

# --- Ralph Loop ---
create_command "ralph-loop" \
	"Start iterative AI development loop (Ralph Wiggum technique)" \
	"$AGENT_BUILD" "" <<'BODY'
Read ${AIDEVOPS_DIR:-$HOME/.aidevops}/agents/workflows/ralph-loop.md and follow its instructions.

Start a Ralph loop for iterative development.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Session Title**: Only set a session title if one hasn't been set already (e.g., by `/ralph-task` which sets `"t042: description"`). If no task-prefixed title exists, use `session-rename` with a concise version of the prompt (truncate to ~60 chars if needed).

**Usage:**
```bash
/ralph-loop "<prompt>" --max-iterations <n> --completion-promise "<text>"
```

**Options:**
- `--max-iterations <n>` - Stop after N iterations (default: unlimited)
- `--completion-promise <text>` - Phrase that signals completion

For end-to-end development, prefer `/full-loop` which handles the complete lifecycle.

**How it works:**
1. You work on the task
2. When you try to exit, the SAME prompt is fed back
3. You see your previous work in files and git history
4. Iterate until completion or max iterations

**Completion:**
To signal completion, output: `<promise>YOUR_PHRASE</promise>`
The promise must be TRUE - do not output false promises to escape.

**Examples:**
```bash
/ralph-loop "Build a REST API for todos" --max-iterations 20 --completion-promise "DONE"
/ralph-loop "Fix all TypeScript errors" --completion-promise "ALL_FIXED" --max-iterations 10
```
BODY

# --- Cancel Ralph ---
create_command "cancel-ralph" \
	"Cancel active Ralph Wiggum loop" \
	"$AGENT_BUILD" "" <<'BODY'
Cancel the active Ralph loop.

Remove the state file to stop the loop:

```bash
rm -f .agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.md .agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.state
```

If no loop state file exists, no loop is active.
BODY

# --- Ralph Status ---
create_command "ralph-status" \
	"Show current Ralph loop status" \
	"$AGENT_BUILD" "" <<'BODY'
Show the current Ralph loop status.

**Check status:**

```bash
cat .agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No active Ralph loop"
```

This shows:
- Whether a loop is active
- Current iteration number
- Max iterations setting
- Completion promise (if set)
- When the loop started
BODY

# --- Preflight Loop ---
create_command "preflight-loop" \
	"Run preflight checks in a loop until all pass (Ralph pattern)" \
	"$AGENT_BUILD" "" <<'BODY'
Run preflight checks iteratively until all pass or max iterations reached.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage:**
```bash
/preflight-loop [--auto-fix] [--max-iterations N]
```

**Options:**
- `--auto-fix` - Attempt to automatically fix issues
- `--max-iterations N` - Max iterations (default: 10)

**Run the checks:**

```bash
${AIDEVOPS_DIR:-$HOME/.aidevops}/agents/scripts/linters-local.sh
```

**Completion promise:** `<promise>PREFLIGHT_PASS</promise>`

This applies the Ralph Wiggum technique to quality checks:
1. Run all preflight checks (linters-local.sh, shellcheck, markdown lint)
2. If failures and --auto-fix: attempt fixes
3. Re-run checks
4. Repeat until all pass or max iterations

**Examples:**
```bash
/preflight-loop --auto-fix --max-iterations 5
/preflight-loop  # Manual fixes between iterations
```
BODY

# --- PR Loop ---
create_command "pr-loop" \
	"Monitor PR until approved or merged (Ralph pattern)" \
	"$AGENT_BUILD" "" <<'BODY'
Monitor a PR iteratively until approved, merged, or max iterations reached.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage:**
```bash
/pr-loop [--pr NUMBER] [--wait-for-ci] [--max-iterations N]
```

**Options:**
- `--pr NUMBER` - PR number (auto-detected if not provided)
- `--wait-for-ci` - Wait for CI checks to complete
- `--max-iterations N` - Max iterations (default: 10)

Read ${AIDEVOPS_DIR:-$HOME/.aidevops}/agents/scripts/commands/pr-loop.md and follow its instructions.

**Completion promises:**
- `<promise>PR_APPROVED</promise>` - PR approved and ready to merge
- `<promise>PR_MERGED</promise>` - PR has been merged

**Workflow:**
1. Check PR status (CI, reviews, mergeable)
2. If changes requested: get feedback, apply fixes, push
3. If CI failed: get annotations, fix issues, push
4. If pending: wait and re-check
5. Repeat until approved/merged or max iterations

**Examples:**
```bash
/pr-loop --wait-for-ci
/pr-loop --pr 123 --max-iterations 20
```
BODY

# --- Postflight Loop ---
create_command "postflight-loop" \
	"Monitor release health after deployment (Ralph pattern)" \
	"$AGENT_BUILD" "" <<'BODY'
Monitor release health for a specified duration.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage:**
```bash
/postflight-loop [--monitor-duration Nm] [--max-iterations N]
```

**Options:**
- `--monitor-duration Nm` - How long to monitor (e.g., 5m, 10m, 1h)
- `--max-iterations N` - Max checks during monitoring (default: 5)

Read ${AIDEVOPS_DIR:-$HOME/.aidevops}/agents/scripts/commands/postflight-loop.md and follow its instructions.

**Completion promise:** `<promise>RELEASE_HEALTHY</promise>`

**Checks performed:**
1. Latest CI workflow status
2. Release tag exists
3. Version consistency (VERSION file matches release)

**Examples:**
```bash
/postflight-loop --monitor-duration 10m
/postflight-loop --monitor-duration 1h --max-iterations 10
```
BODY

# --- Ralph Task ---

	"Run Ralph loop for a task from TODO.md by ID" \
	"$AGENT_BUILD" "" <<'BODY'
Run a Ralph loop for a specific task from TODO.md.

Task ID: $ARGUMENTS

**Workflow:**
1. Find task in TODO.md by ID (e.g., t042)
2. Extract ralph metadata (promise, verify command, max iterations)
3. **Set session title** using `session-rename` tool with format: `"t042: Task description here"`
4. Start Ralph loop with extracted parameters

**Task format in TODO.md:**
```markdown
- [ ] t042 Fix all ShellCheck violations #ralph ~2h
  ralph-promise: "SHELLCHECK_CLEAN"
  ralph-verify: "shellcheck .agents/scripts/*.sh"
  ralph-max: 10
```

**Or shorthand:**
```markdown
- [ ] t042 Fix all ShellCheck violations #ralph(SHELLCHECK_CLEAN) ~2h
```

**Usage:**
```bash
/ralph-task t042
```

This will:
1. Read TODO.md and find task t042
2. Extract the ralph-promise, ralph-verify, ralph-max values
3. Set session title to `"t042: {task description}"` using `session-rename` tool

- Task must have `#ralph` tag
- Task should have completion criteria defined
