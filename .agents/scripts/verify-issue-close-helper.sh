# verify-issue-close-helper.sh — Pre-close verification for issue closing (GH#17372)
#
# Prevents workers from closing issues against unrelated PRs by verifying that
# the cited PR's diff actually touches files mentioned in the issue body.
#
# Background: A worker dispatched for GH#15544 found a recently-merged PR that
# touched a related file and concluded it must contain the fix. It didn't verify
# that the PR modified the specific code paths identified in the bug reports.
# Both issues were closed without fixes. This helper prevents that failure mode.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-issue-close-helper.sh check <issue_number> <pr_number> <repo_slug>
#     Verify that a PR's changed files overlap with files mentioned in the issue.
#     Exit 0 = verified (safe to close), exit 1 = not verified (do NOT close)
#
#   verify-issue-close-helper.sh extract-paths <issue_number> <repo_slug>
#     Extract file paths mentioned in an issue body. Useful for debugging.
#
#   verify-issue-close-helper.sh help
#     Show usage information.
