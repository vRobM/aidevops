Dispatch one or more workers. Route by work type:

- **Code changes** (repo edits, tests, PRs) -> `/full-loop`
- **Operational work** (reports, audits, monitoring, outreach) -> direct command execution

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Scope

**`/runners` is a targeted dispatcher, not a supervisor.** It resolves explicit items, launches one worker per item, shows the dispatch table, and stops. It does NOT run supervisor phases, auto-pickup, stale recovery, or audits. Use `/pulse` for unattended slot-filling (`scripts/commands/pulse.md`).

Workers stay isolated: `/runners` never touches source code, tests, branches, or merge conflicts. If a worker fails, fix the worker prompt or workflow, not the dispatcher.

## Input Types

| Pattern | Type | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| `GH#\d+` | GitHub issue/PR numbers | `/runners GH#267 GH#268` |
| `t\d+` | Task IDs from TODO.md | `/runners t083 t084 t085` |
| `#\d+` or PR URL | PR numbers | `/runners #382 #383` |
| Issue URL | GitHub issue | `/runners https://github.com/user/repo/issues/42` |
| Free text | Description | `/runners "Fix the login bug"` |

## Step 1: Resolve Items

Resolve each input to a description:

```bash
gh issue view 267 --repo <slug> --json number,title,url
gh pr view 268 --repo <slug> --json number,title,headRefName,url
grep -E "^- \[ \] t083 " TODO.md
gh issue view 42 --repo user/repo --json number,title,url
```

## Step 2: Dispatch Workers

Launch each worker via `headless-runtime-helper.sh run` — the **ONLY** valid dispatch path. It builds the lifecycle prompt, handles provider rotation, preserves sessions, and applies backoff. NEVER use bare `opencode run` or workers may stop after PR creation (GH#5096).

Use the `--detach` flag to self-daemonize the worker and return control to the calling agent immediately. This is the preferred pattern for agent-to-agent dispatch.

```bash
AGENTS_DIR="$(aidevops config get paths.agents_dir)"
HELPER="${AGENTS_DIR/#\~/$HOME}/scripts/headless-runtime-helper.sh"

# Code task (Build+ is default; omit --agent)
$HELPER run \
  --detach \
  --role worker \
  --session-key "task-t083" \
  --dir ~/Git/<repo> \
  --title "t083: <description>" \
  --prompt "/full-loop t083 -- <description>"
# Returns immediately with: "Dispatched PID: 12345"
```

### Manual Redirection (Legacy)

If using an older version of `aidevops` without `--detach`, redirect at the caller level to avoid blocking the interactive session:

```bash
$HELPER run ... </dev/null >>/tmp/worker-${session_key}.log 2>&1 &
sleep 2
```

### Dispatch Rules

- `--dir ~/Git/<repo-name>` must match the target repo
- `--agent <name>` routes to a specialist; omit it for code tasks (Build+ default)
- `/full-loop` only for tasks needing repo code changes and PR traceability
- `--detach` is recommended for agent-to-agent dispatch to avoid blocking
- Do NOT add `--model` unless escalation is required by workflow policy

## Step 3: Show Dispatch Table

After dispatch, show what was launched:

```text
## Dispatched Workers

| # | Item | Worker |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | GH#267: <title> | dispatched |
| 2 | GH#268: <title> | dispatched |
```

Then stop. `/pulse` or a later operator action handles follow-up.
