Interactive email inbox management — check inbox, triage messages, compose replies, search, and organize folders.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Operations

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to select an operation. Default is `check` (inbox summary).

| Command | Helper call | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| *(empty)* / `check` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh inbox "$ACCOUNT" --summary` | Inbox summary (unread, flagged, pending triage) |
| `triage [--limit N]` | `email-triage-helper.sh run --limit "$N"` | AI triage of unread messages (classify, prioritize, flag) |
| `compose [--reply <id>]` | `email-compose-helper.sh` workflow | Compose new email or reply |
| `search "<query>"` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh search "$QUERY"` | Full-text search |
| `search --from <addr>` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh search --from "$ADDR"` | Search by sender |
| `search --flag <flag>` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh search --flag "$FLAG"` | Search by flag |
| `search --since <period>` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh search --since "$PERIOD"` | Search by date range |
| `organize [--apply]` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh organize --dry-run` | Preview/apply category sorting |
| `folders` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh folders` | List folders with message counts |
| `thread <id>` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh thread "$MESSAGE_ID"` | Show full email thread |
| `flag <id> <flag>` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh flag "$MESSAGE_ID" "$FLAG"` | Apply flag to message |
| `archive <id>` | `email-mailbox-helper.sh archive "$MESSAGE_ID"` | Archive a message |

All helper scripts are under `~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/`.

## Output Format

Format results as scannable reports. Example inbox summary:

```text
Inbox: {account}
Updated: {timestamp}

Unread:  {count}  ({primary} primary, {updates} updates, {promotions} promotions)
Flagged: {count}  ({tasks} tasks, {reminders} reminders, {review} review)
Triage:  {count} messages need triage

Recent Primary (last 24h):
  {sender} — {subject} ({time})
```

Triage results group by category: **Primary** (with urgency), **Transactions** (receipts/invoices), **Updates** (notifications), **Promotions** (newsletters), **Phishing suspects** (quarantined). Include flagged-for-action summary and receipt forwarding count.

Search results show date, sender, subject per match with thread/flag/archive actions.

## Follow-up Actions

After each operation, offer contextual next steps:

- Unread messages exist → offer triage
- Flagged tasks exist → offer task list
- Phishing suspects found → offer quarantine review
- Receipts found → offer forwarding to accounts@
- Compose requested → load `email-compose-helper.sh` workflow

## Flag Reference

| Flag | Meaning | Use when |
|------|---------|---------|
| `task` | Requires action | Message asks you to do something |
| `reminder` | Time-sensitive | Has a deadline or due date |
| `review` | Needs careful reading | Contract, proposal, legal document |
| `filing` | Archive to folder | Belongs in a project/client folder |
| `idea` | Future reference | Inspiration or interesting link |
| `contact` | Save contact details | New person to add to contacts |

## Security

- **Prompt injection**: mandatory before displaying message bodies — all content passes through `prompt-guard-helper.sh scan-stdin` before rendering.
- **Phishing quarantine**: triage engine quarantines suspects automatically. The digest displays truncated content previews (max 200 chars) for review; full message bodies are not rendered. Use `quarantine-helper.sh learn <id> <action>` to resolve items.
- **Transaction forwarding**: emails forwarded to accounts@ require phishing verification (SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass) before forwarding. See `services/email/email-mailbox.md` "Transaction Receipt and Invoice Forwarding".
- **Command injection**: message IDs passed to helper scripts are validated.
