# Worktree Cleanup After Merge

After a PR is merged, clean up the linked worktree and return the canonical repo to a clean state.

## Automated Cleanup (workers — GH#6740)

Workers dispatched via `/full-loop` MUST self-cleanup after successful merge (Step 4.9). The pulse `cleanup_worktrees()` stage acts as a safety net, but workers must not rely on it — self-cleanup prevents accumulation during batch dispatch.

```bash
# After gh pr merge --squash succeeds:
WORKTREE_PATH="$(pwd)"
BRANCH_NAME="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
CANONICAL_DIR="${WORKTREE_PATH%%.*}"

cd "$CANONICAL_DIR" || cd "$HOME"
git pull origin main 2>/dev/null || true

HELPER="$HOME/.aidevops/agents/scripts/worktree-helper.sh"
if [[ -x "$HELPER" ]]; then
  WORKTREE_FORCE_REMOVE=true "$HELPER" remove "$BRANCH_NAME" --force 2>/dev/null || true
else
  git worktree remove --force "$WORKTREE_PATH" 2>/dev/null || true
  git worktree prune 2>/dev/null || true
fi

git push origin --delete "$BRANCH_NAME" 2>/dev/null || true
git branch -D "$BRANCH_NAME" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Cleanup failures are non-fatal — the PR is already merged.

## Manual Cleanup (interactive sessions)

```bash
# Merge without --delete-branch (required from inside a worktree)
gh pr merge --squash

# Return to canonical repo and pull
cd ~/Git/$(basename "$PWD" | cut -d. -f1)
git pull origin main

# Remove merged worktrees
wt prune
```

## Key Rules

- **Do not use `--delete-branch`** with `gh pr merge` from inside a worktree — the branch is checked out there, not in the canonical repo.
- `wt prune` removes worktrees whose branches have been merged and deleted on the remote. Run from the canonical repo (on `main`).
- If `wt prune` is unavailable, use `git worktree prune` then manually delete the worktree directory.
