Log an issue with the aidevops framework to GitHub.

**Arguments**: Optional title hint, e.g., `/log-issue-aidevops "Update check not working"`

All issues from non-collaborators are gated behind `needs-maintainer-review` — a maintainer must approve before the pipeline picks them up. This command produces higher-quality reports than the web form because it gathers diagnostics, checks duplicates, and validates before submission.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Diagnostics

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/log-issue-helper.sh diagnostics
```

Collects: aidevops version (local + latest), AI assistant, OS/shell, repo context, `gh` CLI version.

### Step 2: Understand the Issue

Ask the user:
1. What happened?
2. What did you expect?
3. Steps to reproduce (if known)?

Use any provided argument as the title starting point. Review session context for commands, errors, and intent.

### Step 3: Check for Duplicates

```bash
gh issue list -R marcusquinn/aidevops --state all --search "KEYWORDS" --limit 10
```

If duplicates found, present them and ask: add comment to existing / create new / review first.

### Step 3.5: Architectural Alignment (enhancements only)

Skip for bugs with clear reproduction steps — bugs are observed failures and belong in the tracker.

For enhancements, feature requests, and architectural changes, evaluate against:

- **Observed failure first**: Is this addressing an actual failure, or preemptive? Preemptive rules are prompt bloat.
- **Intelligence over determinism**: Does this add a deterministic gate where model judgment would work better?
- **Prompt cost**: Every instruction has a per-turn cost. Is the value worth it?
- **External pattern adoption**: A "gap" vs another framework may be a deliberate omission in an intelligence-first design.

If the proposal doesn't survive these questions, discuss before filing — it may be better as a memory entry.

### Step 4: Compose the Issue

```markdown
## Description
{problem}

## Expected Behavior
{what should have happened}

## Steps to Reproduce
1. {step}

## Environment
{diagnostics output}

## Additional Context
{errors, session context}
```

### Step 5: Confirm Before Submitting

Show the user: title, body preview, label. Offer: create / edit title / edit description / cancel.

### Step 6: Create the Issue

```bash
gh issue create -R marcusquinn/aidevops \
  --title "TITLE" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
BODY_CONTENT
EOF
)" \
  --label "LABEL"
```

### Step 7: Confirm Success

Output the issue URL. Note: user can add comments, subscribe to notifications, or reference with `Fixes #NNN`.

## Label Selection

| Issue Type | Label |
|------------|-------|
| Something broken | `bug` |
| New feature request | `enhancement` |
| Question/help needed | `question` |
| Documentation issue | `documentation` |
| Performance problem | `performance` |

## Privacy

Diagnostics do NOT include credentials or tokens. File paths are included (may reveal username). No file contents uploaded. User reviews everything before submission.

## Error Handling

- `gh` not authenticated: prompt `gh auth login`, then retry.
- Network failure: prompt user to check connection and retry.
