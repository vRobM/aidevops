# Session Review - Completeness and Best Practices Audit

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Review current session for completeness, workflow adherence, and knowledge capture
- **Trigger**: `/session-review` command, end of significant work, before ending session
- **Output**: Structured assessment with actionable next steps

**Review categories**: (1) Objective completion, (2) Workflow adherence, (3) Conversation value extraction + knowledge capture, (4) Session health.

**Key outputs**: Completion score (0-100%), outstanding items, value extraction report, knowledge capture recommendations, session continuation advice.

## Command Usage

```bash
/session-review [focus]    # focus: objectives | workflow | knowledge | all (default)
```

## Review Process

### Step 1: Gather Session Context

```bash
git branch --show-current && git log --oneline -10
grep -A 20 "## In Progress" TODO.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No TODO.md"
git status --short
test -f .agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.md && head -10 .agents/loop-state/ralph-loop.local.md || \
test -f .claude/ralph-loop.local.md && head -10 .claude/ralph-loop.local.md
gh pr list --state open --limit 5 2>/dev/null || echo "No open PRs"
```

### Step 2: Objective Completion Assessment

Score by comparing initial request to current state:

| Check | Method | Weight |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Initial request fulfilled | Compare first message to current state | 40% |
| TODO items completed | Count `[x]` vs `[ ]` in session scope | 20% |
| Branch purpose achieved | Compare branch name to commits | 20% |
| Tests passing | Run test suite | 10% |
| No blocking errors | Check for unresolved issues | 10% |

Output: score, completed items `[x]`, outstanding items `[ ]` with blockers, scope changes.

### Step 3: Workflow Adherence Check

| Practice | Check | Required? |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Pre-edit git check | On feature branch, not main | Required |
| TODO tracking | Tasks logged in TODO.md | Recommended |
| Commit hygiene | Atomic commits, clear messages | Required |
| Quality checks | Linters run before commit | Recommended |
| Issue-sync | `issue-sync-helper.sh status` after PR merge | Recommended |
| Documentation | Changes documented where needed | Situational |

Output: practices followed, practices missed with recommendations.

### Step 4: Auto-Distill Session Learnings

**MANDATORY**: Run session distillation to extract and store learnings from git commits:

```bash
~/.aidevops/agents/scripts/session-distill-helper.sh auto
```

Analyses commits for patterns (fixes, features, refactors), extracts learnings (ERROR_FIX, WORKING_SOLUTION, etc.), stores to memory.

### Step 5: Conversation Value Extraction + Knowledge Capture

**MANDATORY**: Re-read the entire conversation. Auto-distill (Step 4) only captures what made it into commits. The conversation contains insights, decisions, and observations not in any artifact.

**Signals to capture:**

| Signal | Example | Capture To |
|--------|---------|------------|
| User direction/philosophy | "always solve root causes" | Agent docs, memory |
| Design decisions with rationale | "POC mode is a flag, not a separate system" | PLANS.md, brief, memory |
| System behaviour observations | "pulse completed 8 tasks in 40 min" | Memory |
| Root cause analyses | "workers search by keyword instead of using authoritative ID" | Code fix + memory |
| Recurring patterns | "three-layer defense: prevent, detect, correct" | Agent docs, memory |
| User preferences/constraints | "skip ceremony for prototypes" | Memory |
| Unfinished threads | "we should also check X" — never did | TODO.md or issue |
| Side discoveries | "GitHub parses Closes #NNN in prose text" | Docs, memory |
| Implicit standards | user corrects an approach — that correction is a standard | Agent docs |
| Bug patterns discovered | Error patterns, tool failures | Code comments, docs |
| Tool discoveries | Unexpected tool behaviour | Relevant subagent |
| Temporary workarounds | Hacks that need proper fixes | TODO.md, code comments |

**Process:**

1. Scan conversation chronologically for each signal type
2. For each finding: already captured in commit, PR, memory, TODO, or doc?
3. Not captured → capture now (memory, docs, TODO, or issue)
4. Partially captured → verify completeness
5. User corrections reveal framework gaps — prioritize these

**The goal is zero knowledge loss.** Every insight traceable to at least one artifact.

Output: newly captured items with locations, already-captured items, unfinished threads with created TODOs/issues.

### Step 6: Session Health Assessment

| Signal | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| All objectives complete | End session |
| PR merged | End or new session |
| Context becoming stale | End session |
| Topic shift requested | New session |
| Blocked on external | End session |
| More work in scope | Continue |

Output: status (Continue/End Recommended/End Required), reason, final actions if ending, next focus if continuing, suggested branches for new sessions.

## Integration Points

- **Before PR creation**: Run to ensure all changes committed, no outstanding items, docs complete.
- **Before ending session**: Capture learnings, update TODO.md, check issue-sync drift (`issue-sync-helper.sh status`, t179.4), ensure clean handoff.
- **After Ralph loop completion**: Verify completion promise met, identify cleanup, suggest next steps.

### Security Summary (t1428.5)

Run `/session-review security` or `session-review-helper.sh security` for a unified post-session security summary aggregating all security subsystems.

```bash
session-review-helper.sh security              # Full summary
session-review-helper.sh security --json       # JSON output
session-review-helper.sh security --session ID # Filter by session
session-review-helper.sh gather --security     # Include in standard gather
```

**Data sources:**

| Source | Data | Script |
|--------|------|--------|
| Cost breakdown | LLM requests by model, token counts, costs | `observability-helper.sh` |
| Audit events | Security event type breakdown, chain integrity | `audit-log-helper.sh` |
| Network access | Logged/flagged/denied domain counts, top flagged | `network-tier-helper.sh` |
| Prompt guard | Blocked/warned/sanitized injection attempts | `prompt-guard-helper.sh` |
| Session context | Composite security score (when t1428.3 available) | `session-security-helper.sh` |
| Quarantine | Pending review items (when t1428.4 available) | `quarantine-helper.sh` |

**Security posture levels:** CLEAN (no events) → LOW (flagged domains/warned injections) → MEDIUM (blocked injections) → HIGH (denied Tier 5 domains) → CRITICAL (audit chain integrity broken).
