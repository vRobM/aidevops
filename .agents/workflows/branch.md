# Branch Workflow

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- Resume existing work first: `git worktree list` or `wt list`
- Start from canonical repo on `main`: `wt switch -c {type}/{name}`
- Fallback: `worktree-helper.sh add {type}/{name}`
- Keep `~/Git/{repo}/` on `main`; do task work in the linked worktree path

| Task Type | Branch Prefix | Subagent |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| New functionality | `feature/` | `branch/feature.md` |
| Bug fix | `bugfix/` | `branch/bugfix.md` |
| Urgent production fix | `hotfix/` | `branch/hotfix.md` |
| Code restructure | `refactor/` | `branch/refactor.md` |
| Docs, deps, config | `chore/` | `branch/chore.md` |
| Spike, POC | `experiment/` | `branch/experiment.md` |
| Version release | `release/` | `branch/release.md` |

- Branch names: `{type}/{short-description}` — lowercase, hyphenated, ~50 chars max. Examples: `feature/user-dashboard`, `bugfix/123-login-timeout`; releases use semver (`release/1.2.0`).
- Planning tasks: move to `## In Progress`, add `started:<ISO>`, then `beads-sync-helper.sh push`.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

Before creating a branch, read `workflows/git-workflow.md` (issue URLs, fork detection, commit/PR rules) and `workflows/worktree.md` (creation, cleanup). Pre-slugify branch names: lowercase, spaces→hyphens, special chars removed. Worktree paths auto-slugified by `generate_worktree_path()` (`/` → `-`, lowercased).

## Branch Lifecycle

Commits: conventional (`feat:` `fix:` `refactor:` `docs:` `chore:` `test:`). Include issue refs when the repo workflow requires them.

| Stage | Command / Agent | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Create | `wt switch -c {type}/{desc}` or `worktree-helper.sh add {type}/{desc}` | Linked worktree from `main` |
| Develop | `branch/{type}.md`, domain agents | Use conventional commits |
| Preflight | `.agents/scripts/linters-local.sh --fast` → `workflows/preflight.md` | Required before push |
| Version | `.agents/scripts/version-manager.sh bump [major\|minor\|patch]` → `workflows/version-bump.md` | Releases only |
| Push | `git push -u origin HEAD` | Remote backup |
| PR | `gh pr create --fill` / `glab mr create --fill` → `workflows/pr.md` | Required |
| Review | `git add . && git commit -m "fix: ..." && git push` → `workflows/code-audit-remote.md` | Address feedback |
| Merge | `gh pr merge --squash` | Required |
| Release | `.agents/scripts/version-manager.sh release [major\|minor\|patch]` → `workflows/release.md` | Releases only |
| Postflight | `gh run watch $(gh run list --limit=1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId') --exit-status` → `workflows/postflight.md` | Releases only |
| Cleanup | `worktree-helper.sh remove {type}/{desc}` / `git push origin --delete {name}` | Remove merged worktree; delete branch if needed |

## Worktree Rules

- Prefer worktrees over `git checkout -b`; the next session must inherit `main`, not a task branch.
- Reference the worktree path (`~/Git/{repo}-{type}-{slug}/`), not "switching the main repo to a branch".
- After switching to a worktree, re-read files at the worktree path before editing.
- Never remove a worktree you did not create unless the user explicitly asked.

## Keeping Branch Updated

```bash
git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main
# Rebase if required; conflicts → tools/git/conflict-resolution.md
```

## Safety: Protecting Uncommitted Work

Before reset, clean, rebase, or checkout with local changes:

```bash
git stash --include-untracked -m "safety: before [operation]"
# ... perform operation ...
git stash pop   # or: git stash show -p to review on conflict
```

`git restore` only recovers tracked files — untracked files are permanently lost without stash.
