# Review External Issues and PRs

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Triage and review issues/PRs — interactive or pulse-automated
- **Focus**: Validate the problem exists, evaluate if the solution is optimal
- **When**: Before approving/merging contributions, or automatically by the pulse for `needs-maintainer-review` items

**Core Questions**:
1. **Is the issue real?** — Reproducible? Bug or expected behavior?
2. **Is this the best solution?** — Simpler alternatives? Fits architecture?
3. **Is the scope appropriate?** — PR does exactly what's needed, no more?

## Issue Review Checklist

### 1. Problem Validation

| Check | Question | How to Verify |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Reproducible** | Can we reproduce? | Follow steps, test locally |
| **Version confirmed** | Occurs on latest? | Check reporter's version vs current |
| **Not duplicate** | Already reported? | Search closed/open issues |
| **Actual bug** | Bug or expected behavior? | Check docs, design decisions |
| **In scope** | Within project scope? | Check project goals, roadmap |

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

- Actual root cause? (Surface symptoms may hide deeper issues)
- Symptom of a larger problem? (Fixing symptoms creates tech debt)
- Why wasn't this caught earlier? (Missing tests or docs?)
- Related issues? (Batch fixes may be more efficient)

## PR Review Checklist

### 3. Solution Evaluation

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Simplicity** | Simpler way? One-liner? Existing utility or stdlib? |
| **Correctness** | Fixes root cause, not just symptom? |
| **Completeness** | Edge cases and error conditions handled? |
| **Consistency** | Follows existing codebase patterns? Right abstraction level? |
| **Performance** | Introduces regressions? |
| **Maintainability** | Easy to maintain, understand, debug? |

### 4. Scope Assessment

| Red Flag | What It Indicates |
|----------|-------------------|
| Unrelated file changes | Scope creep — should be separate PR |
| Refactoring mixed with fixes | Hard to review, may hide issues |
| "While I was here" changes | Increases risk, harder to revert |
| Missing from PR description | Undocumented changes are suspicious |

### 5. Architecture Alignment

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Patterns** | Follows existing code patterns? |
| **Dependencies** | New deps added? Are they justified? |
| **API surface** | Changes public APIs intentionally? |
| **Breaking changes** | Breaks backward compatibility? |
| **Test coverage** | Adequate tests for the right things? |

## Review Output Format

Heading MUST contain `## Review:` or `## Issue/PR Review:` — pulse idempotency guard uses this marker to detect existing triage reviews.

```markdown
## Review: Approved / Needs Changes / Decline

### Issue Validation

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Reproducible | Yes/No | [details] |
| Not duplicate | Yes/No | [related issues] |
| Actual bug | Yes/No | [or expected behavior?] |
| In scope | Yes/No | [project goal alignment] |

**Root Cause**: [Brief description]

### Solution Evaluation (if PR)

| Criterion | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Simplicity | Good/Needs Work | [simpler alternatives?] |
| Correctness | Good/Needs Work | [fixes root cause?] |
| Completeness | Good/Needs Work | [edge cases?] |
| Consistency | Good/Needs Work | [follows patterns?] |

**Alternatives**: [Recommended approach] - [why]

### Scope & Recommendation

- Scope creep: Low/Medium/High
- Complexity: Low (`tier:simple`) / Medium (sonnet) / High (`tier:thinking`)
- **Decision**: APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / DECLINE
- **Labels**: [e.g., `tier:simple`, `bug`, `status:available`]
- **Implementation guidance**: [key steps, test cases to add]
```

## Headless / Pulse-Driven Mode

When invoked by pulse (via `/review-issue-pr <number>`):

1. Fetch issue/PR: `gh issue view` or `gh pr view`
2. Read codebase files referenced in the issue body
3. Run full review checklist (validation, root cause, solution, scope)
4. Post review comment: `gh issue comment` or `gh pr comment`
5. Do NOT modify labels — pulse handles label transitions
6. Exit cleanly — no worktree, no PR, no commit

The review comment is the only output. Pulse detects it next cycle; maintainer responds with "approved", "declined", or direction. If dispatch prompt includes prior maintainer comments, address those concerns specifically.

## Common Scenarios

### Issue is Not a Bug

```markdown
After investigation, this is expected behavior:
- [Why this is by design]
- [Link to docs]

To request different behavior, open a feature request. Closing as "not a bug" — reopen with additional context if needed.
```

### PR Fixes Symptom, Not Cause

```markdown
The fix works for the reported case, but the root cause should be addressed:
- **Current approach**: [what the PR does]
- **Root cause**: [underlying issue]
- **Suggested approach**: [better solution]

Would you be open to updating? Happy to discuss.
```

### PR Has Scope Creep

```markdown
Core fix looks good, but some changes should be separate PRs:
- **In scope** (keep): [change 1], [change 2]
- **Out of scope** (separate PR): [change 3] — [reason]

Could you split this into focused PRs?
```

### Better Alternative Exists

```markdown
There's a simpler approach:
- **Your approach**: [summary]
- **Alternative**: [simpler solution] — preferable because [reason]

Would you be open to updating? Or I can make the change.
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
gh issue view 123 --json title,body,labels,author,createdAt,comments
gh issue list --search "keyword" --state all
gh pr view 456 --json title,body,files,additions,deletions,author
gh pr diff 456 --stat
gh pr checks 456
gh pr review 456 --comment --body "Comment text"
gh pr review 456 --request-changes --body "Please address..."
gh pr review 456 --approve --body "LGTM!"
gh issue close 123 --comment "Closing because..."
rg "relevant_function" --type js --type ts --type py --type sh
git log --oneline -20 -- path/to/affected/file
```

## Labels for Triage

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `needs-reproduction` | Cannot reproduce, need more info |
| `needs-investigation` | Valid issue, needs root cause analysis |
| `good-first-issue` | Simple fix, good for new contributors |
| `help-wanted` | We'd welcome a PR for this |
| `wontfix` | By design or out of scope |
| `duplicate` | Already reported |
| `invalid` | Not a real issue |
