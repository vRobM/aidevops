## CLI Automation — asc

For programmatic App Store Connect management (builds, TestFlight, metadata, screenshots, subscriptions, submissions), use the `asc` CLI. See `tools/mobile/app-store-connect.md` for full documentation.

```bash
brew install tddworks/tap/asccli
asc auth login --key-id KEY --issuer-id ISSUER --private-key-path ~/.asc/AuthKey.p8
asc apps list
```

The checklists below cover compliance requirements. The `asc` CLI automates the execution.

## Metadata Optimisation (ASO)

### App Name

- Include primary keyword naturally
- Keep under 30 characters (Apple) / 50 characters (Google)
- Brand name + keyword is ideal pattern

### Keywords (Apple)

- 100 character limit, comma-separated
- Don't repeat words from app name
- Include common misspellings
- Use singular forms (Apple matches plurals)
- No spaces after commas

### Description

- First 3 lines are visible without "Read More" — make them count
- Lead with the core value proposition
- Use short paragraphs and bullet points
- Include social proof if available (awards, press, user count)
- End with a call to action

### Localisation

- Localise metadata for target markets (even if app is English-only)
- Localised screenshots significantly improve conversion
- Consider top markets: US, UK, Germany, Japan, Brazil, France
