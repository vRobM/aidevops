# Design Library

AI-readable design system examples for inspiration and reference. Each `DESIGN.md` file follows the [Google Stitch DESIGN.md format](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/design-md/format/) with 9 sections capturing a complete visual design system.

│   └── preview.html.template  -- Parameterised HTML/CSS for visual catalogue (light+dark)
├── brands/                    -- Real brand examples (55 sites, educational use)
