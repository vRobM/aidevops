# Design System: Expo — Layout Principles

## Spacing System

- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 1px, 2px, 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 64px, 80px, 96px, 144px
- Button padding: 0px 12px (unusually compact — height driven by line-height)
- Card internal padding: approximately 24–32px
- Section vertical spacing: enormous (estimated 96–144px between major sections)
- Component gap: 16–24px between sibling elements

## Grid & Container

- Max container width: approximately 1200–1400px, centered
- Hero: centered single-column with massive breathing room
- Feature sections: alternating layouts (image left/right, full-width showcases)
- Card grids: 2–3 column for feature highlights
- Full-width sections with contained inner content

## Whitespace Philosophy

- **Gallery-like pacing**: Each section feels like its own exhibit, surrounded by vast empty space. This creates a premium, unhurried browsing experience.
- **Breathing room is the design**: The generous whitespace IS the primary design element — it communicates confidence, quality, and that each feature deserves individual attention.
- **Content islands**: Sections float as isolated "islands" in the white space, connected by scrolling rather than visual continuation.

## Border Radius Scale

- Nearly squared (4px): Small inline elements, tags
- Subtly rounded (6px): Buttons, form inputs, combo boxes — the functional interactive radius
- Comfortably rounded (8px): Standard content cards, containers
- Generously rounded (16px): Feature tabs, content panels
- Very rounded (24px): Buttons, video/image containers, tabpanels — the signature softness
- Highly rounded (32–36px): Hero CTAs, status badges, nav buttons
- Pill-shaped (9999px): Primary action buttons, tags, avatars — maximum friendliness
