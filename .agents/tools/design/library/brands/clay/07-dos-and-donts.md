# Clay Design System: Do's and Don'ts

## Do

- Use warm cream (`#faf9f7`) as the page background — the warmth is the identity
- Apply all 5 OpenType stylistic sets on Roobert headings: `"ss01", "ss03", "ss10", "ss11", "ss12"`
- Use the named swatch palette (Matcha, Slushie, Lemon, Ube, Pomegranate, Blueberry) for section backgrounds
- Apply the playful hover animation: `rotateZ(-8deg)`, `translateY(-80%)`, hard shadow `-7px 7px`
- Use warm oat borders (`#dad4c8`) — not neutral gray
- Mix solid and dashed borders for visual variety
- Use generous radius: 24px for cards, 40px for sections
- Use weight 600 exclusively for headings, 500 for UI, 400 for body

## Don't

- Don't use cool gray backgrounds — the warm cream (`#faf9f7`) is non-negotiable
- Don't use neutral gray borders (`#ccc`, `#ddd`) — always use the warm oat tones
- Don't mix more than 2 swatch colors in the same section
- Don't skip the OpenType stylistic sets — they define Roobert's character
- Don't use subtle hover effects — the rotation + hard shadow is the signature interaction
- Don't use small border radius (<12px) on feature cards — the generous rounding is structural
- Don't use standard shadows (blur-based) — Clay uses hard offset and multi-layer inset
- Don't forget the uppercase labels with 1.08px tracking — they're the wayfinding system
