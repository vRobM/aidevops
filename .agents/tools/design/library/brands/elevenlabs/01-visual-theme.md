# Design System: ElevenLabs — Visual Theme & Atmosphere

ElevenLabs' website is a study in restrained elegance — a near-white canvas (`#ffffff`, `#f5f5f5`) where typography and subtle shadows do all the heavy lifting. The design feels like a premium audio product brochure: clean, spacious, and confident enough to let the content speak (literally, given ElevenLabs makes voice AI). There's an almost Apple-like quality to the whitespace strategy, but warmer — the occasional warm stone tint (`#f5f2ef`, `#777169`) prevents the purity from feeling clinical.

The typography system is built on a fascinating duality: Waldenburg at weight 300 (light) for display headings creates ethereal, whisper-thin titles that feel like sound waves rendered in type — delicate, precise, and surprisingly impactful at large sizes. This light-weight display approach is the design's signature — where most sites use bold headings to grab attention, ElevenLabs uses lightness to create intrigue. Inter handles all body and UI text with workmanlike reliability, using slight positive letter-spacing (0.14px–0.18px) that gives body text an airy, well-spaced quality. WaldenburgFH appears as a bold uppercase variant for specific button labels.

What makes ElevenLabs distinctive is its multi-layered shadow system. Rather than simple box-shadows, elements use complex stacks: inset border-shadows (`rgba(0,0,0,0.075) 0px 0px 0px 0.5px inset`), outline shadows (`rgba(0,0,0,0.06) 0px 0px 0px 1px`), and soft elevation shadows (`rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 4px 4px`) — all at remarkably low opacities. The result is a design where surfaces seem to barely exist, floating just above the page with the lightest possible touch. Pill-shaped buttons (9999px) with warm-tinted backgrounds (`rgba(245,242,239,0.8)`) and warm shadows (`rgba(78,50,23,0.04)`) add a tactile, physical quality.
