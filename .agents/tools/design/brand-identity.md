# Brand Identity Bridge

Per-project brand identity bridging design and content agents. A designer picks "Glassmorphism + Trust Blue" — this ensures the copywriter knows it means "confident, technical, concise."

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Template**: `context/brand-identity.toon` in each project repo
- **8 dimensions**: Visual style, voice & tone, copywriting, imagery, iconography, buttons & forms, media & motion, brand positioning
- **Create**: From scratch or existing site via `tools/design/ui-ux-inspiration.md`
- **Related**: `content/guidelines.md`, `content/platform-personas.md`, `content/production-image.md`, `workflows/ui-verification.md`
- **When to use**: Before any design or content work. If `context/brand-identity.toon` is missing, create one first.

## Agent Integration

Every agent producing design or content output MUST check `context/brand-identity.toon` — constraint, not suggestion.

| Agent type | Reads |
|------------|-------|
| All | `brand_positioning` |
| Design | `visual_style`, `iconography`, `buttons_and_forms`, `media_and_motion` |
| Content | `voice_and_tone`, `copywriting_patterns`, `imagery` |
| Production | `imagery`, `iconography`, `media_and_motion`, `visual_style` |

- `content/humanise.md`: Pass `voice_and_tone` to preserve brand personality during AI pattern removal
- `workflows/ui-verification.md`: Brand identity adds constraints but never relaxes verification gates

## Workflow

**From scratch**: (1) Visual interview via `tools/design/ui-ux-inspiration.md` → UI style, palette, typography; (2) Verbal interview → voice, tone spectrums, CTAs, words to avoid; (3) Imagery & motion → image style, icon library, animation level; (4) Brand positioning → walk each spectrum; (5) Synthesise into `context/brand-identity.toon`, flag contradictions, iterate.

**From existing site**: (1) URL study via `tools/design/ui-ux-inspiration.md` → extract colours, typography, UI patterns; (2) Read 5-10 pages → identify voice, CTAs, error messages; (3) Present as filled template; (4) Refine — what stays/changes/is missing; (5) Merge kept elements with new directions, flag breaking changes.

## Relationship Map

`context/brand-identity.toon` readers: `tools/design/ui-ux-inspiration.md` (writes it), `content/guidelines.md` (structural rules), `content/platform-personas.md` (voice shifts), `content/production-image.md` (image gen params), `content/production-characters.md` (character personality), `content/humanise.md` (preserve personality), `workflows/ui-verification.md` (adds constraints), `tools/design/ui-ux-catalogue.toon` (records choices).

## Example: Launchpad (developer deploy tool)

[brand_positioning]
premium_vs_accessible = 4  playful_vs_serious = 4  technical_vs_simple = 7  global_vs_local = 8
tagline = "Ship your side project. Tonight."

competitive_differentiator = "Zero-config deploys that actually work. No YAML, no Dockerfiles, no 47-step tutorials."
