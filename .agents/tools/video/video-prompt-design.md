# Video Prompt Design

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Generate professional AI video prompts using structured meta prompt architecture
- **Primary Model**: Google Veo 3 (8s max, 1080p, 24fps, 16:9)
- **Framework**: 7-component format (Subject, Action, Scene, Style, Dialogue, Sounds, Technical)
- **Source**: [Veo 3 Meta Framework](https://github.com/snubroot/Veo-3-Meta-Framework)

**When to Use**: Read this when crafting prompts for AI video generation (Veo 3, Sora, Kling, etc.)

**Core Format** (all 7 components required for professional quality):

```text
Subject:   [Character with 15+ physical attributes]
Action:    [Movements, gestures, timing, micro-expressions]
Scene:     [Environment, props, lighting, weather, time of day]
Style:     [Camera shot, angle, movement, colour palette, depth of field]
Dialogue:  (Character Name): "Speech" (Tone: descriptor)
Sounds:    [Ambient, effects, music, environmental audio]
Technical: [Negative prompt - elements to exclude]
```

**Critical Techniques**:
- Camera positioning: Include `(that's where the camera is)` for spatial anchoring
- Dialogue format: `(Character Name): "Speech" (Tone: descriptor)` — colon syntax prevents subtitle generation
- Audio: Always specify environment audio to prevent hallucinations
- Character consistency: Use identical descriptions across a series
- Duration: 12-15 words / 20-25 syllables for 8-second dialogue

## Detailed Guidance

### Character Development

Build characters with 15+ specific attributes for consistency across generations:

```text
[NAME], a [AGE] [ETHNICITY] [GENDER] with [HAIR_DETAILS], [EYE_COLOUR] eyes,
[FACIAL_FEATURES], [BUILD], wearing [CLOTHING], with [POSTURE],
[EMOTIONAL_STATE], [ACCESSORIES], [VOICE_CHARACTERISTICS]
```

Required attributes: age, ethnicity, gender, hair (colour/style/length/texture), eyes, facial features, build, clothing, posture, mannerisms, emotional baseline, voice, distinctive features, professional indicators, personality markers.

**Consistency rule**: Use the exact same character description wording across all prompts in a series.

### Camera Work

#### Shot Types

| Shot | Framing | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| EWS | Full environment | Scale, context |
| WS | Full body | Character in environment |
| MS | Waist up | Conversation, standard |
| CU | Head/shoulders | Emotion, connection |
| ECU | Eyes/mouth | Intense emotion |

#### Movement Keywords

| Movement | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `static shot` | Stability, authority |
| `dolly in/out` | Emotional intimacy control |
| `pan left/right` | Scene revelation |
| `tracking shot` | Subject following |
| `handheld` | Authenticity, energy |
| `crane shot` | Dramatic reveals |

**Movement quality modifiers** (add to Action component): `natural movement`, `energetic movement`, `slow and deliberate`, `graceful`, `confident`, `fluid`

**Physics keywords**: `realistic physics governing all actions`, `proper weight and balance`, `natural fluid dynamics`

#### Camera Positioning Syntax

Always include spatial context for the camera:

```text
"Close-up shot with camera positioned at counter level (that's where the camera is)
as the character demonstrates the product"
```

### Dialogue Design

**8-second rule**: 12-15 words, 20-25 syllables maximum per generation.

Always specify tone and delivery:

```text
(Character Name): "Exact dialogue here"
(Tone: warm confidence with professional authority)
```

### Audio Engineering

**Always specify environment audio** to prevent hallucinations:

```text
Sounds: quiet office ambiance, keyboard typing, no audience sounds, professional atmosphere
```

| Setting | Audio Elements |
|---------|---------------|
| Kitchen | Sizzling, chopping, boiling, utensils, ambiance |
| Office | Keyboard, fans, notifications, paper, professional |
| Workshop | Tools, machinery, metal, equipment, industrial |
| Outdoors | Wind, birds, traffic (distant), footsteps, natural |

### Negative Prompts (Technical Component)

**Universal quality negatives** (include in every prompt):

```text
subtitles, captions, watermark, text overlays, words on screen, logo, branding,
poor lighting, blurry footage, low resolution, artifacts, unwanted objects,
inconsistent character appearance, audio sync issues, amateur quality,
distorted hands, oversaturation, compression noise, camera shake
```

### Selfie Video Formula

```text
A selfie video of [CHARACTER]. [He/She] holds the camera at arm's length.
[His/Her] [arm] is clearly visible in the frame. [He/She] occasionally
looks into the camera before [ACTION]. The image is slightly grainy,
looks very film-like. [He/She] says: "[DIALOGUE_8S_MAX]"
```

### Veo 3 Limitations

- Maximum 8 seconds per generation
- Complex multi-character scenes reduce consistency
- Rapid camera movements cause motion blur
- Background audio hallucinations without explicit specification
- Text/subtitles appear unless negated
- Hand/finger details need careful negative prompting
- 16:9 landscape is the primary supported aspect ratio

## Post-Processing Enhancement

After generating with Veo/Sora/Runway, enhance via `real-video-enhancer-helper.sh`. See `content/video-real-video-enhancer.md` for full docs.

| Use Case | Enhancement |
|----------|-------------|
| Social media delivery | 720p → 1080p upscale + 24fps → 60fps interpolation |
| Cinematic to social | 24fps → 48/60fps interpolation |
| Low-quality source | Denoise + upscale |
| 4K delivery | 1080p → 4K upscale |
| Artifact removal | H.264 decompression |

**Typical production workflow**:
1. **Prompt Design** (this guide) → Craft optimal prompts
2. **Generation** (`video-gen-helper.sh`) → Generate with Sora/Veo/Runway
3. **Enhancement** (`real-video-enhancer-helper.sh enhance raw.mp4 final.mp4 --scale 2 --fps 60 --denoise`) → Upscale, interpolate, denoise
4. **Post-Production** (color grading, audio mixing) → Final polish
5. **Distribution** (platform-specific encoding) → Deliver to platforms

See `content/production-video.md` for full pipeline integration.
