# Cross-Provider Verification Agent

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Purpose

Verify high-stakes operations by obtaining an independent judgment from a different AI provider before execution. Different providers have different failure modes, so cross-provider verification catches single-model hallucinations that same-provider checks would miss.

**Design principle:** Targeted verification only. Not every operation needs a second opinion -- only those where an error would cause irreversible damage. The cost of a haiku-tier verification call (~$0.001) is negligible compared to the cost of a destructive mistake.

## When to Verify

The verification agent is invoked when an operation matches the high-stakes taxonomy. Operations are classified by **risk tier**:

### Risk Tier: Critical (always verify)

Operations where a mistake causes data loss, security breach, or service outage:

- `git push --force` to any shared branch
- `git reset --hard` on branches with unpushed commits
- Database schema migrations (DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE)
- Production deployments and rollbacks
- Secret rotation or credential changes
- DNS record modifications
- Firewall rule changes
- User permission escalation (granting admin/owner roles)
- Deleting cloud resources (VMs, databases, storage buckets)

### Risk Tier: High (verify unless explicitly skipped)

Operations where a mistake is costly but recoverable:

- Merging PRs that touch >10 files or >500 lines
- Bulk file operations (delete, move, rename across directories)
- Package major version upgrades
- CI/CD pipeline configuration changes
- Infrastructure-as-code changes (Terraform, Pulumi)
- API endpoint removal or breaking changes

### Risk Tier: Standard (verify on request)

Operations where verification adds value but isn't mandatory:

- Complex refactoring across multiple modules
- Security-sensitive code changes (auth, crypto, input validation)
- Performance-critical path modifications
- Cross-service integration changes

## Cross-Provider Selection Logic

The verifier must use a **different provider** from the primary model to avoid correlated failures.

### Selection Rules

1. **Identify the primary provider** from the model that proposed the operation:
   - `claude-*` or `anthropic/*` -> primary is Anthropic
   - `gemini-*` or `google/*` -> primary is Google
   - `gpt-*` or `openai/*` -> primary is OpenAI
   - `o1-*` or `o3-*` -> primary is OpenAI

2. **Select the verifier provider** (preference order):
   - If primary is Anthropic -> Google (haiku -> flash), then OpenAI
   - If primary is Google -> Anthropic (flash -> haiku), then OpenAI
   - If primary is OpenAI -> Anthropic (haiku), then Google

3. **Fallback to same-provider different-model** if no cross-provider key is available:
   - Anthropic sonnet -> Anthropic haiku (less effective but better than nothing)
   - Log a warning: same-provider verification has reduced effectiveness

4. **Provider availability check** before verification:

   ```bash
   # Check if the selected verifier provider is available
   model-availability-helper.sh check <provider>
   ```

   If the preferred verifier is unavailable, try the next provider in the preference chain.

### Cost Constraints

- Verification calls use the **cheapest tier** of the verifier provider (haiku/flash/gpt-4.1-mini)
- Maximum verification prompt: 2000 tokens input, 500 tokens output
- If the operation context exceeds 2000 tokens, summarize before sending to verifier

## Verification Prompt Template

The verifier receives a structured prompt describing the operation. It does NOT see the primary model's reasoning -- only the operation itself and its context.

```text
You are a safety verification agent. An AI assistant is about to perform the
following operation. Your job is to independently assess whether this operation
should proceed.

## Operation
{operation_type}: {operation_description}

## Context
- Repository: {repo_name}
- Branch: {branch_name}
- Working directory: {working_dir}
- Files affected: {file_count} files, {line_count} lines changed

## Specific Details
{operation_details}

## Your Assessment

Respond in exactly this JSON format:
{
  "verified": true|false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "concerns": ["list of specific concerns, empty if none"],
  "recommendation": "proceed|warn|block",
  "reasoning": "1-2 sentence explanation"
}

Rules:
- "proceed": Operation looks safe, no concerns
- "warn": Operation has minor concerns but can proceed with caution
- "block": Operation has serious concerns and should NOT proceed without review
- Be conservative: when in doubt, recommend "warn" not "proceed"
- Focus on: data loss risk, security implications, reversibility, blast radius
```

## Disagreement Handling

When the verifier's recommendation differs from the primary model's intent:

### Protocol

| Verifier Says | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| `proceed` (confidence >= 0.8) | Execute the operation |
| `proceed` (confidence < 0.8) | Execute but log the low confidence for review |
| `warn` | Show concerns to the user, ask for confirmation |
| `block` | Do NOT execute. Show concerns and reasoning to the user |

### Escalation Path

1. **Verifier says `block`**: Stop execution immediately. Present the verifier's concerns to the user with the full context. The user decides whether to override.

2. **Verifier says `warn`**: Present concerns inline. If running autonomously (headless dispatch), pause and create a GitHub issue describing the concern. If interactive, ask the user.

3. **Repeated disagreements** (3+ blocks in a session): Escalate to opus-tier for a tiebreaker assessment. The opus call receives both the operation context and the verifier's concerns, and makes the final recommendation.

4. **Verifier unavailable** (all providers down or no API keys): Log the verification skip, proceed with a warning. Never block operations solely because verification infrastructure is unavailable -- that would make the safety system a reliability liability.

### Override Mechanism

Users can bypass verification with explicit flags:

```bash
# Skip verification for a specific operation
verify-operation-helper.sh verify --skip "reason for skipping"

# Disable verification for the session (not recommended)
export AIDEVOPS_SKIP_VERIFY=1
```

All skips are logged to the observability DB with the reason.

## Observability

Every verification decision is logged via `observability-helper.sh record` with these fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `provider` | Verifier provider (e.g., "google") |
| `model` | Verifier model ID |
| `project` | Repository/project name |
| `stop_reason` | Verification result: "proceed", "warn", "block" |
| `session_id` | Session that triggered verification |

Additional verification-specific fields are logged to a dedicated JSONL file:

```text
~/.aidevops/.agent-workspace/observability/verifications.jsonl
```

Each entry contains:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "operation_type": "git_force_push|db_migration|...",
  "risk_tier": "critical|high|standard",
  "primary_provider": "anthropic",
  "verifier_provider": "google",
  "verifier_model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20",
  "result": "proceed|warn|block",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "concerns": [],
  "was_overridden": false,
  "override_reason": null,
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "branch": "feature/xyz"
}
```

## Integration Points

The verification agent is called by `verify-operation-helper.sh` which provides the CLI interface. Pipeline integration (t1364.3) will wire this into:

1. **Pre-commit hooks**: For critical-tier git operations
2. **Dispatch pipeline**: Before executing destructive operations in headless mode
3. **PR merge flow**: For large or security-sensitive PRs

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Verify an operation before execution
verify-operation-helper.sh verify \
  --operation "git push --force origin main" \
  --type "git_force_push" \
  --risk-tier "critical" \
  --repo "owner/repo" \
  --branch "main"

# Check if an operation needs verification
verify-operation-helper.sh check \
  --operation "git push origin feature/foo"

# View/update verification configuration
verify-operation-helper.sh config [--show|--set KEY=VALUE]
```
