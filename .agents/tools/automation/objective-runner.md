# @objective-runner - Safe Long-Running Objectives

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

> **ARCHIVED (t1336):** `objective-runner-helper.sh` has been archived to `scripts/archived/`.
> Use `/full-loop` instead — it provides the same iterative execution with AI judgment
> rather than deterministic bash guardrails.

## Quick Reference

- **Use instead**: `/full-loop "objective description"` for iterative task execution
- **Runner dispatch**: `runner-helper.sh` for single-shot named agents
- **Multi-task dispatch**: `/runners` for parallel task dispatch, `/pulse` for autonomous orchestration
- **Archived script**: `scripts/archived/objective-runner-helper.sh` (1,334 lines, reference only)

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-END -->

## Why Archived

The objective runner was a bash-based loop with deterministic guardrails (budget limits,
step counts, checkpoint reviews, rollback). `/full-loop` replaces this with AI-guided
iteration that makes better decisions about when to stop, retry, or escalate.

See `scripts/archived/objective-runner-helper.sh` for the original implementation.
