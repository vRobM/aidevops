# Product UI Design - Beautiful by Default

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START -->

## Quick Reference

- **Purpose**: Ensure every product is simple, clean, stylish, and beautiful
- **Principle**: Aesthetics drive downloads; usability drives retention
- **Standards**: Apple HIG, Material Design 3, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- **Tools**: Vision AI for asset generation, Remotion for animated previews, Gemini for SVG design
- **Applies to**: Mobile apps, browser extensions, desktop apps, web apps

**Design pillars**:

1. **Simple** - Remove everything that isn't essential
2. **Clean** - Generous whitespace, clear hierarchy, consistent spacing
3. **Stylish** - Modern typography, refined colour palettes, subtle animations
4. **Beautiful** - Attention to detail in every pixel, delightful micro-interactions
5. **Accessible** - Usable by everyone, passes WCAG 2.1 AA

## Design System Foundation

### Colour Palette

Every product needs a coherent colour system:

| Role | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Primary | Brand colour, CTAs, active states | Blue, purple, coral |
| Secondary | Supporting actions, accents | Complementary to primary |
| Background | Screen/page backgrounds | White/near-white (light), black/near-black (dark) |
| Surface | Cards, sheets, elevated elements | Slightly tinted background |
| Text | Primary content | Near-black (light), near-white (dark) |
| Text secondary | Labels, captions, metadata | Grey |
| Success | Positive actions, confirmations | Green |
| Warning | Caution states | Amber/orange |
| Error | Destructive actions, errors | Red |
| Border | Dividers, input borders | Light grey |

**Dark mode is mandatory**. Design both light and dark themes from the start. Use semantic colour tokens, not hardcoded values.

### Typography

- **System fonts preferred** (SF Pro for iOS, Roboto for Android, system-ui for web) — they render best on each platform
- **Custom fonts** only when brand identity requires it
- **Type scale**: Title, Headline, Body, Caption, Footnote — no more than 5 sizes
- **Line height**: 1.4-1.6x for body text, 1.2x for headings
- **Weight contrast**: Use weight (not size) to create hierarchy where possible

### Spacing and Layout

- **8px grid**: All spacing in multiples of 8 (8, 16, 24, 32, 48)
- **Safe areas**: Respect device safe areas on mobile (notch, home indicator, status bar)
- **Touch/click targets**: Minimum 44x44pt (iOS) / 48x48dp (Android) / 44x44px (web)
- **Content width**: Max 600px for readability on wide screens
- **Card padding**: 16px minimum internal padding

### Icons

**Product icon requirements**:

- Must be distinctive at small sizes and full resolution
- No text in the icon (illegible at small sizes)
- Simple, recognisable silhouette
- Consistent with product's colour palette and mood
- Test against competitor icons — must stand out in search results

**In-product icons**:

- SF Symbols (iOS), Material Icons (Android), Lucide/Heroicons (web/extensions)
- Consistent weight and size throughout the product
- Use filled variants for selected/active states, outlined for inactive

### Animations and Micro-Interactions

Animations should feel natural and purposeful:

| Type | When | Duration |
|------|------|----------|
| Page transitions | Navigation between screens/pages | 250-350ms |
| Button feedback | Tap/click response | 100-150ms |
| Loading states | Data fetching | Skeleton screens, not spinners |
| Success feedback | Completed action | 200-400ms with haptics (mobile) |
| Error feedback | Failed action | Shake animation + haptics (mobile) |
| List items | Enter/exit | Staggered 50ms delay per item |
| Pull to refresh | Content refresh | Spring physics (mobile) |

**Haptic feedback** (mobile) should accompany meaningful interactions:

- Light impact: Button taps, toggles
- Medium impact: Successful actions, selections
- Success: Task completion, achievement
- Warning: Approaching limits, caution
- Error: Failed actions, destructive confirmations

## Asset Generation

### Product Icons

Use vision AI tools for icon generation:

- `tools/vision/image-generation.md` for AI-generated icon concepts
- Gemini Pro for SVG icon design (strong at clean vector graphics)
- Test multiple concepts with model contests for best results

### Screenshots and Preview Media

- `tools/browser/remotion-best-practices-skill.md` for animated store preview videos
- `tools/vision/` for marketing graphics and feature illustrations
- Playwright device emulation for automated screenshot capture across devices

### Illustration Style

Choose one illustration style and maintain consistency:

- **Flat**: Clean, modern, minimal shadows
- **3D**: Depth, lighting, premium feel
- **Hand-drawn**: Warm, approachable, personal
- **Geometric**: Abstract, tech-forward, clean
- **Photographic**: Real imagery, authentic feel

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### iOS (Apple Human Interface Guidelines)

- Use native navigation patterns (tab bar, navigation stack)
- Respect system gestures (swipe back, pull down to dismiss)
- Support Dynamic Type for accessibility
- Use SF Symbols for consistent iconography

### Android (Material Design 3)

- Use Material You dynamic colour theming
- Bottom navigation bar for primary destinations
- FAB (Floating Action Button) for primary actions
- Predictive back gesture support

### Browser Extensions

- Popup UI should be compact (max 400x600px typical)
- Match the browser's visual language (light/dark mode)
- Sidebar panels can be more spacious
- Options page follows standard web design

### Desktop Apps

- Respect platform conventions (menu bar on macOS, title bar on Windows)
- Support keyboard shortcuts extensively
- Resizable windows with sensible minimum sizes
- Native-feeling drag and drop

### Web Apps

- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Progressive enhancement
- Fast initial load (skeleton screens)
- Accessible navigation (keyboard, screen reader)

## Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] Colour contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 for text, >= 3:1 for large text
- [ ] All interactive elements have accessibility labels
- [ ] Screen reader navigation order is logical
- [ ] Touch/click targets are >= 44x44pt minimum
- [ ] Animations respect "Reduce Motion" system setting
- [ ] Text scales with system font size settings
- [ ] No information conveyed by colour alone
- [ ] Focus indicators visible for keyboard/switch navigation
